            "body": "<p>Alibaba Group is planning to overhaul the design of its artificial intelligence chatbot, as the Chinese tech giant tries to make the struggling app more competitive, Bloomberg reported.</p>\n\n<p>In China’s consumer AI chatbot market, Alibaba’s Tongyi app lags far behind rival apps developed by other Chinese tech giants, such as ByteDance’s Doubao and Tencent Holdings’ Yuanbao. In October, Doubao had 159 million monthly active users, while Tongyi only had 7.4 million, according to <a href=\"http://aicpb.com/\">AIcpb.com</a>, a Chinese website that tracks AI apps.</p>\n\n<p>As part of the makeover, the Tongyi app will change its name to Qwen, the same as Alibaba’s AI models, according to Bloomberg. After the redesign, the Alibaba app&nbsp;is expected to look more like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, including features such as shopping, the report said.</p>\n\n<p>Alibaba is one of China’s leaders in AI model development, and it has an advantage in AI services for corporate customers thanks to the strength of Alibaba Cloud, China’s largest cloud service provider. However, when it comes to AI apps for consumers, Alibaba trails ByteDance, whose Doubao chatbot is China’s most popular AI app. To appeal to consumers, Alibaba earlier this year overhauled its Quark AI search app and turned it into an all-purpose AI assistant.</p>",

The Times&nbsp;originally asked for 1.4 billion chats but later narrowed the request to 20 million, a random sample of chats between December 2022 and November 2024. Judge Ona Wang, who is overseeing the case in the Southern District of New York, has sided with the Times, ordering OpenAI to hand over the chats by Friday.</p>\n\n<p>While OpenAI said it is removing personal identifying information from the chats, it is still fighting the court on handing over the information, as OpenAI treats users chats with ChatGPT as “among the most sensitive information in your digital life,” according to a a blog post on Wednesday from Dane Stuckey, chief information security officer at OpenAI. A&nbsp;New York Times spokesperson said OpenAI’s blog “purposely misleads.”</p>\n\n<p>“No ChatGPT user’s privacy is at risk,” the spokesperson said. “This fear-mongering is all the more dishonest given that OpenAI’s own terms of service permit the company to train its models on users’ chats and turn over chats for litigation.”</p>",

Skims currently has 18 stores, in addition to selling its products online and through other retailers like Saks and Bloomingdale’s. The company is profitable and its net sales this year will be over $1 billion, the company said. Last year, the company <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/skims-chime-take-new-steps-to-2025-ipos?rc=d8mrkd\">had been preparing to interview banks</a> to lead an initial public offering, but Skims CEO Jens Grede has since downplayed the idea of an IPO.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to expanding its retail footprint, Skims has been branching out into new categories. It recently launched a line of athletic clothing through a collaboration with Nike that could expand to footwear and accessories in the future. Skims also acquired a stake in Kardashian’s beauty brand from cosmetics giant Coty in March and recently hired an executive to launch beauty and fragrance products for Skims.</p>",

Still, Amazon is retaining different pricing models for the two services. Advertisers using Amazon’s tools to buy across the Web generally pay a transaction fee while brands buying space on Amazon’s marketplace pay based on whether a user clicks or how many people saw it.</p>\n\n<p>Amazon also rolled out a suite of agents that makes it easier for advertisers to figure out which audiences they want to target or which campaigns they want to run. But the agents will not actually buy the ads themselves, which is difficult because of the complex business relationships between social media platforms, publishers and advertisers, as The Information has <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/ai-ad-tech-land-grab-pits-salesforce-google-microsoft-amazon\">reported</a>.

Shareholders controlling 1.9 billion shares voted in favor, while fewer than 600 million&nbsp;voted against it. Shareholders with 12 million shares abstained, while 300 million did not vote. While all the board members who were up for re-election won, the vote was somewhat closer for one of the directors, Ira Ehrenpreis. About 1.6 billion shares were cast in Ehrenpreis’s favor, while 850 million were against.</p>",

In the next 10 to 20 years, AI could take over human work and society could face a big challenge, Chen said, according to Reuters.</p>\n\n<p>DeepSeek became a global sensation in late January after it released R1, an open-sourced reasoning model with performance on par with OpenAI’s similar model at the time but trained at lower costs.
