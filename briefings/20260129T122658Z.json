            "body": "<p>Microsoft revenue grew 17% to $81.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2025, a slightly lower rate of year-over-year growth than in the previous quarter. But Microsoft said it had $625 billion in remaining performance obligations as of the end of December, also known as a revenue backlog, up from $392 billion in the September quarter, implying it has plenty of revenue growth ahead.&nbsp;&nbsp;The company also disclosed it had 15 million paying subscribers of 365 Copilot, the suite of AI features for Office apps such as Excel and Word.</p>\n\n<p>Revenue from Azure and other cloud services grew 39% in the fourth quarter, compared to 40% growth in the quarter prior. Microsoft doesn’t break out Azure revenue in dollars. The company’s shares fell 4% in after-hours trading.</p>\n\n<p>The revenue backlog rise reflects OpenAI’s recent commitment to spend $250 billion on Microsoft’s Azure cloud over an unspecified period, which the companies announced in October. Microsoft said 45% of its remaining performance obligations came from OpenAI, or $281.2 billion, while the rest came from other customers’ bookings, including Anthropic. Microsoft said it will take 2.5 years, on average, for that backlog to turn into revenue.</p>\n\n<p>Microsoft has been pouring money into new data centers and servers equipped with Nvidia chips in order to meet demand from OpenAI, Anthropic, and other AI customers. The company’s capital expenditures in the December quarter were $37.5 billion, up 66% compared to last year, with two thirds of that spending going towards short-lived assets like chips. Free cash flow for the December quarter was $5.9 billion, down 9% from a year ago, which the company said was due to rising capital expenditures.</p>\n\n<p>Microsoft for the first time disclosed the number of paying subscribers of Office 365 Copilot software, which uses models from OpenAI and Anthropic to power AI features in its Office apps. Microsoft said the 15 million figure only includes subscribers who pay a monthly rate per seat, which starts at $30 per month. That implies the software is on track to generate billions of dollars in annual revenue, though many companies receive discounts when buying subscriptions in bulk. By comparison, OpenAI’s ChatGPT had 35 million paying users <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/newsletters/ai-agenda/went-wrong-openais-year-agents?rc=geicgp\">as of last July</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Microsoft also reported earnings per share of $5.16, which were much higher than usual because OpenAI <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/microsoft-gets-27-stake-openai-access-models-2032?rc=geicgp\">completed its restructuring in October</a> and granted Microsoft a 27% stake in the company for the first time. With the restructuring, Microsoft now reports gains and losses on its OpenAI stake after previously reporting a share of OpenAI’s operating losses. For consistency, Microsoft also reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $4.14 that excluded accounting for its OpenAI stake.</p>",

Chinese officials have spent the past weeks balancing the imports of the H200 chips—which are needed to develop China’s AI systems—against the long-term goal of cultivating semiconductor technology independence. While the H200 is the most powerful AI chip currently available to Chinese buyers, it remains less advanced than Nvidia’s latest Blackwell processors.</p>\n\n<p>The Information reported earlier this month that Beijing told tech companies they could only buy H200 chips in special circumstances, without specifying the criteria. Last week, Bloomberg reported that ByteDance, Alibaba, and Tencent had received in principle approval for the H200 chips.</p>",

In particular, the company has become popular for coding-related tasks, in part due to its coding agent Claude Code, which generated more than $1 billion in annualized revenue in November.</p>\n\n<p>But costs are adding up. The company revised its most optimistic&nbsp; projections to delay turning cash flow positive till 2028, a year later than previously expected. It projects to generate $2.2 billion in cash in 2028. Higher costs to train and run its AI models have contributed to the delay. This year, the company expects to spend $12 billion on training its models and $7 billion on running them for its paying users.</p>\n\n<p>The company is raising more than $10 billion at a valuation of $350 billion before the financing in a round led by Singapore’s GIC and Coatue Management.

But Amazon <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/zombie-amazon-grocery-stores-pile-up-as-openings-grind-to-a-halt?rc=d8mrkd\">slowed store openings starting in 2022</a> and ditched the Just Walk Out tech in the stores altogether <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/amazons-grocery-stores-to-drop-just-walk-out-checkout-tech?rc=d8mrkd\">in 2024</a>. Amazon said it’s closing the nearly 60 U.S. Fresh store locations because it hadn’t “created a truly distinctive customer experience.”</p>\n\n<p>Amazon has pushed to aggressively grow its grocery business without expanding Fresh, both through its Whole Foods Market stores as well as its fast-growing grocery delivery services. In 2025, Amazon added smaller Whole Foods Market stores and <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/amazon-plans-new-u-s-ultrafast-delivery-offering?rc=d8mrkd\">30-minute delivery</a> for “everyday essentials” like paper towels, produce and energy drinks.
