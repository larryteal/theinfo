            "body": "<p>SpaceX chief financial officer Bret Johnsen confirmed to the company’s staff that it was preparing for an IPO next year, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/business/spacex-tells-staff-it-is-preparing-for-a-potential-ipo-next-year-ae54778d?mod=hp_lead_pos5\">the Wall Street Journal reported.</a>&nbsp;His statement follows <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/spacex-tells-investors-aiming-late-2026-ipo?rc=9byxri\">The Information’s report on Dec. 5</a> that SpaceX, part of Elon Musk’s empire, was planning an IPO in the second half of next year.</p>\n\n<p>The Journal report said Johnsen sent a memo to staff telling them: “The thinking is that if we execute brilliantly and the markets cooperate, a public offering could raise a significant amount of capital.” He also confirmed SpaceX’s new valuation of $800 billion, the Journal report said.</p>\n\n<p>His note also said the timing of the IPO was still highly uncertain. SpaceX had long been considered unlikely to go public, although there was speculation it could spin off its Starlink internet-access business as a public entity. But Musk’s interest in launching data centers in space is reportedly making an IPO of SpaceX more appealing, as it could help the company raise a lot of money.</p>",

The company previously took an <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-14/tether-says-it-acquired-minority-stake-in-juventus-football-club\">undisclosed minority stake</a> in Juventus in February. Italian-born Paolo Ardoino, Tether’s chief executive since 2023, said in a statement Friday that he “grew up with this team” and that “Tether is in a position of strong financial health and intends to support Juventus with stable capital and a long horizon.”</p>\n\n<p>Terms of the Tether proposal include a bid to buy out the roughly 65% of Juventus shares owned by Exor, the holding company of the Agnelli family. If that bid is successful, Tether said it plans to submit a public tender offer for remaining shares in the Turin-based club. Tether also pledged in its statement to invest €1 billion into Juventus, if it is able to take ownership of the team.</p>\n\n<p>Juventus is one of global soccer’s most famous clubs, having won 36 Serie A titles and two UEFA Champions League trophies. Since 1923, it has been owned and managed by the Agnelli family, whose patriarch founded Fiat automobiles and whose holdings now span Ferrari, The Economist magazine and health tech firm Philips, among others. John Elkann, heir to the Agnelli family and chief executive of Exor, was named to the board of Meta in January.</p>\n\n<p>Juventus was not known to be for sale. A breakdown of Exor’s portfolio earlier this year valued its stake in the club at €795 million. A spokesman for Exor did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>",

But earlier this week the exclusivity period for its letter of intent on the site expired before the companies could reach a final agreement, and the funding deal was terminated, Fermi said.</p>\n\n<p>Fermi said it has begun deal talks with other potential tenants for the data center site, which is expected to be powered in 2026.

Broadcom shares rose 3% in -after-hours trading.</p>\n\n<p>But AI chips are less than half of Broadcom’s business and other parts of the company are performing less robustly, which dilutes the growth impact. Broadcom CEO Hock Tan forecast that AI chip revenue would double in the company’s first fiscal quarter, through January, while total revenue would only rise 28% to $19.1 billion, the same growth rate as the fourth quarter.</p>\n\n<p>Broadcom’s free cash flow is growing faster than its topline, however. In the fourth quarter, free cash flow hit $7.466 billion, up 36% on the year-earlier quarter.</p>\n\n<p>Tan also said on the firm’s earnings call that Anthropic was the customer who placed a $10 billion order last quarter. He said Anthropic&nbsp;bought racks of Google’s tensor processing units. Anthropic placed another $11 billion order in the current quarter for the chips, Tan added. The Information first reported on Google’s plans&nbsp;to sell its TPUs directly to customers, instead of renting them through&nbsp;Google Cloud, in an effort to compete more directly with Nvidia.</p>",
