Apple has acquired several AI-based security camera companies over the years, including <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-acquires-ai-device-startup-silk-labs\">Silk Labs</a> in 2018 and <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/dde4fe\">Lighthouse AI</a> in 2019. Apple has been working on its own smart home camera for years and is expected to release the product next year, according to analysts and Bloomberg.</p>\n\n<p>The Prompt deal was likely very small, with the startup having only raised a $5 million seed round. The deal continues Apple’s tradition of absorbing smaller technology firms primarily for talent, rather than buying up larger companies. Apple is often wary of larger acquisitions due, in part, to the complexity of integrating big teams into Apple’s unique corporate culture, The Information has previously <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apples-aversion-big-deals-thwart-ai-push\">reported</a>.</p>",

The court’s decision follows a deposition of OpenAI co-founder and former chief scientist Ilya Sutskever last week.</p>\n\n<p>Musk’s lawyers are seeking further information from Sutskever concerning his financial interests in OpenAI, which could include rights to OpenAI’s future profits, and a document called the “Brockman Memo,” an apparent reference to OpenAI’s president and co-founder Greg Brockman.&nbsp;Sutskever’s lawyers say that details of his financial interests are “a constitutionally protected privacy interest.”&nbsp;The court has initially denied Musk’s request because his lawyers filed the document after midnight on the deadline. Musk’s lawyers contend that they encountered a technical difficulty that delayed the filing to 12:08 a.m. The court has asked Musk’s lawyers whether their attempts to submit the filing meet the court’s criteria for a deadline extension.</p>\n\n<p>Lawyers for OpenAI and Microsoft opposed the request to depose Murati, saying Musk missed the deadline and the timing would give Musk an unfair advantage. Musk’s lawyers said they attempted to serve Murati a deposition subpoena eleven times with no success. The court found that “OpenAI is mistaken” about the timing issue and “Musk’s motion has merit.”</p>\n\n<p>These are just the latest conflicts over evidence discovery in the Musk-Altman lawsuit, in which lawyers for both sides have frequently asked the court to intervene to force the other side to produce more documents. Musk, a co-founder and early donor to OpenAI, is suing the ChatGPT maker <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/musks-legal-battle-openais-structure-total-long-shot\">for a variety of claims</a>, including that OpenAI has allegedly violated its charitable mission by acting as a for-profit company.</p>\n\n<p><em>This story has been updated to reflect the latest filings concerning Sutskever.</em></p>",

The new rules, which expanded from earlier restrictions announced in April, also limit&nbsp;the export of technologies used for rare earth production and recycling.</p>\n\n<p>The new rules could affect chip giants like Nvidia, if the company’s suppliers need to apply for Beijing’s licenses in order to purchase large quantities of rare earths from China. Rare earths are used in several components for Nvidia chips and servers, such as those&nbsp;in the cooling system.</p>\n\n<p>China produces the vast majority of the world’s rare earths. As U.S.-China geopolitical tensions have escalated in recent years, China’s control of rare earths has given Beijing leverage in its trade negotiations with Washington.</p>",
