The operator of ChatGPT is leading a sweeping global push to build massive new data centers for AI — a project likely to cost trillions of dollars and consume vast amounts of chips, servers, cooling systems and electricity.</p>\n\n<p>OpenAI said in a <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/samsung-and-sk-join-stargate/\">statement</a> that its demand for high-bandwidth memory could reach as much as 900,000 wafers per month. SK Hynix said in a <a href=\"https://eng.sk.com/news/sk-group-partners-with-openai-to-advance-global-ai-infrastructure\">separate statement</a> that this would be more than double the industry’s current production capacity.</p>\n\n<p>SK Hynix is the worldwide leader in supplying high-bandwidth memory, which is critical for Nvidia’s chips, while Samsung is working to take a larger share of the fast-growing market. The companies are the latest to support OpenAI’s global AI infrastructure buildout alongside Nvidia and Oracle.</p>\n\n<p>After Seoul, Altman was set to visit Taipei for meetings with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and Hon Hai Precision Industry, also known as Foxconn, major partners in the AI server supply chain, local Taiwanese reports said.</p>",

Stripe is also planning to apply for a trust license with the New York State Department of Financial Services, he said.</p>\n\n<p>Stripe <a href=\"https://stripe.com/newsroom/news/tour-newyork-2025\">announced</a> a new service today to help clients launch their own stablecoins “in days.” So far, crypto wallet providers Phantom and Metamask, as well as Native Markets for Hyperliquid, are using Stripe’s services to issue stablecoins.</p>\n\n<p>The move could introduce more competition to Circle and Tether, the dominant stablecoin issuers whose tokens are currently used by many of Stripe’s clients. It will also add to a rapidly increasing number of stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies that are typically pegged to the dollar. Stripe will allow its clients to receive all the interest revenue generated from their own stablecoins, minus a fee that starts at 0.5% of assets.</p>\n\n<p>Stripe aims to make its stablecoin issuance service “as big as possible,” said Neetika Bansal, Stripe’s business lead for connect, money management and crypto.

It also requires AI companies to report to state officials if their models are involved in safety incidents, such as theft of a model that is then used to cause harm.</p>\n\n<p>State AI laws have been under scrutiny this year due to Congressional attempts to ban states from passing their own AI laws. Senator Ted Cruz’s attempt to include such a ban in the ‘Big Beautiful’ budget bill failed, but efforts to reintroduce a ban are ongoing.</p>\n\n<p>SB 53 has been one of the <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/two-state-ai-laws-watch\">most watched</a> state AI bills of the year, in part because it follows an earlier AI safety bill from the same author, state senator Scott Wiener, which Newsom vetoed last year. In the wake of his veto, Newsom assembled a working group to issue policy recommendations, such as transparency measures and whistleblower protections, which SB 53 adopted.</p>\n\n<p>Newsom said last week that SB 53 “strikes the right balance” in terms of respecting the interests of the AI industry. The bill was <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/amazons-ar-glasses-help-train-humanoid-delivery-robots\">endorsed by</a> Anthropic, as well as former Y Combinator president Geoff Ralston and Mythos Ventures, and Elicit, a startup developing an AI research assistant.</p>",

Initially, products available will come from small merchants who sell on Etsy, while “over a million Shopify merchants” including Glossier and Spanx, are “coming soon.”</p>\n\n<p>When users ask ChatGPT for product recommendations, the chatbot will list out its suggestions, along with details like the product’s price, availability and whether this new feature, called “Instant Checkout,” is enabled. The company said that Instant Checkout items will not get a boost in product rankings.</p>\n\n<p>After the user orders a product, the merchant will handle the details, including sending out a confirmation email and handling any returns and support. The user can see the order in ChatGPT and track it on the merchant’s site. However, Instant Checkout doesn’t let merchants sign up customers for marketing emails for orders placed through ChatGPT. Instant Checkout is powered by an open standard built by OpenAI and Stripe called the “Agentic Commerce Protocol.”</p>",
