            "body": "<p>The executive in charge of Apple’s hugely successful in-house chip design efforts is eyeing an exit from the company, Bloomberg reported.</p>\n\n<p>Johny Srouji, Apple’s senior vice president of hardware technologies, has told the company’s CEO, Tim Cook, that he is “seriously considering” departing Apple in the near future, the publication reported. If he leaves, Srouji has also told colleagues his next move will be to join another company, Bloomberg reported.</p>\n\n<p>Such a departure would be a blow to Apple, which has seen unusually high levels of turnover in its senior ranks lately. This week alone, the company announced the departure of four senior leaders, including John Giannandrea, its AI head; Alan Dye, one of its design chiefs; Kate Adams, general counsel; and Lisa Jackson, vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives.</p>\n\n<p>A spokesman for Apple didn’t have an immediate comment.</p>\n\n<p>Cook’s own future at Apple has been the subject of intense speculation as well, as The Information <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/silicon-valley-buzzing-apple-ceo-succession?rc=ndc4g0\">reported on Friday</a>. Cook recently turned 65 and became CEO nearly 15 years ago. Some current and former Apple executives believe Apple is likely to name a successor to Cook in the coming years.</p>",

In September, Mehta released his preliminary judgment on remedies, which required that Google stop exclusive search distribution contracts and mandated some data sharing with search engine rivals but avoided the most extreme remedies such as forcing a sale of Chrome that plaintiffs led by the Department of Justice had requested.</p>\n\n<p>After the September judgment, <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/antitrust-judge-bars-google-exclusive-deals-require-chrome-sale?rc=n9lbpq\">viewed</a> by antitrust experts as a positive outcome for the search company, Google and the Department of Justice filed separate <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/google-justice-department-file-dueling-remedies-proposals-antitrust-search-case?rc=n9lbpq\">proposals</a> dueling over how to interpret the judge’s ruling. Friday’s final judgment hewed more closely to the government’s proposal, including Mehta’s decision on generative AI products. The judge also ruled that Google must renegotiate any contracts for search or generative AI defaults every year, and that agreements with Apple have to be device-by-device and access point by access point.</p>\n\n<p>Google and the Department of Justice did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Google previously said that it would appeal Mehta’s initial finding of the illegal monopoly, and the Department of Justice said after Mehta’s remedies ruling earlier this month that it was considering its options.</p>",

The EU <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_2934\">cited</a> several issues with X’s practices, including the “deceptive design” of X’s blue checkmark system, which the bloc said makes it “difficult for users to judge the authenticity of accounts” and makes it more likely they will fall for scams and manipulation. X has also failed to adequately maintain a database of ads or share information with researchers, which are requirements under the DSA, the EU said.</p>\n\n<p>For Musk, maintaining the X site has been less of a priority this year than growing xAI, his artificial intelligence company, which acquired X in March. Musk has been trying to run X as leanly as possible, including by replacing some staff with xAI’s Grok artificial intelligence model, The Information has <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/twins-pushing-elon-musks-plans-replace-x-staff-grok\">reported</a>. While the EU fine is smaller than previous EU fines against American tech firms, it is almost certain to inflame tensions between the U.S. and EU. On Thursday, U.S. Vice President JD Vance <a href=\"https://x.com/JDVance/status/1996701953372704921\">wrote</a> on X that the “EU should be supporting free speech not attacking American companies over garbage.”</p>",

The Information reproduced some of the results Thursday.</p>\n\n<p>Enterprise AI startup Sierra, privately valued at $10 billion, powered the chatbot for Gap. Rachel Whetstone, head of communications at Sierra, which was co-founded by former Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor, said the issue stemmed from a coordinated effort to trick its customers’ chatbots to respond to inappropriate questions.</p>\n\n<p>“Since last week, a bad actor has been attempting to maliciously jailbreak over a dozen of our customers’ AI agents,” Whetstone said in a statement. “There have been multiple attempts, and it appears our built-in abuse detection system has intercepted all of them except for Gap, where we’d inadvertently misconfigured the agent’s guardrails. These controls have now been properly configured, and the agent remains live. We sincerely apologize to Gap.”</p>\n\n<p>It isn’t clear how many Gap customers engaged in off-color topics with the assistant, and Gap spokespeople didn’t respond to requests for comment.</p>\n\n<p>The episode is another example of AI chatbots and agents being a work in progress.

The report is a sign that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has recognized that the company has to curb its spending in some areas as it ramps up spending on AI. Meta stock has fallen sharply in recent weeks, since the company said it was doubling-down on AI investments, although it rose 3.8% on Thursday morning in the wake of the Bloomberg report.</p>\n\n<p>Over the past few years, Meta has lost tens of billions of dollars at its Reality Labs unit, which includes the metaverse group. As of the third quarter, it had lost $13.2 billion so far this year.</p>",

In the second quarter, Agentforce’s ARR was $440 million, up 400%. Together with Salesforce’s Data&nbsp;360 data product, Salesforce’s AI-related revenue hit an annual revenue rate of $1.4 billion.</p>\n\n<p>Salesforce has battled questions all year about whether businesses were ready to buy AI software, and whether its business was threatened by competition from new AI services. Its AI-related revenue&nbsp;remains small for Salesforce overall. Its quarterly revenue was $10.3 billion and the company projected full year revenue of around $41.5 billion, up between 9% and 10%. That growth rate includes a contribution from the recent acquisition of Informatica. Salesforce has gradually raised its projection for fiscal 2026 revenue growth from between 7% and 8% issued earlier this year.</p>",
