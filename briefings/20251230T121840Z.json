            "body": "<p>Meta Platform is acquiring Manus, an artificial intelligence agent that went viral earlier this year and got financial backing from Benchmark, in the U.S. tech giant’s latest move to expand its AI offerings.</p>\n\n<p>The deal will give Manus, operated by a Singapore-based startup called Butterfly Effect, access to Meta’s massive user base that includes millions of businesses and billions of people. “Joining Meta allows us to build on a stronger, more sustainable foundation without changing how Manus works or how decisions are made,” said Xiao Hong, CEO of Manus, in a statement.</p>\n\n<p>The deal comes at a time when Manus, like most other AI startups, hasn’t figured out how to build a profitable business on its own. Earlier this month, Manus said that its annual run rate has just reached $125 million, up from $90 million in August.</p>\n\n<p>Launched in March, Manus uses AI foundation models from Anthropic and others to power its agent. It was one of the pioneers among startups that launched general-purpose AI agents earlier this year. The company now has 105 employees in Singapore, Tokyo and San Francisco, and plans to open a Paris office soon, the spokesperson said.</p>\n\n<p>The deal is a big win for venture capital firms backing Manus. Butterfly Effect, founded by a group of tech entrepreneurs from China, raised $75 million in April in a funding round led by Benchmark at a valuation of $500 million, <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/startup-behind-manus-ai-agent-navigates-u-s-china-tensions-benchmark-deal?rc=jnr9wn\">The Information reported</a> previously. Its other backers include Chinese venture capital firms ZhenFund and HongShan, as well as Chinese tech giant Tencent.</p>",

Several other senior executives have quit or have been fired.</p>\n\n<p>Alt5 in early December appointed Victor Mokuolo CPA PLLC as the company’s new independent auditor, following the resignation of the company’s previous auditor. Texas state filings show the license of the new audit firm expired in August, meaning the firm is currently barred from doing audit work, the Financial Times <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/342d01b2-bf0f-47d7-bb61-0f1aa0997ffd\">reported</a> on Monday.</p>\n\n<p>In a securities filing on Monday, Alt5 Sigma said it had “dismissed” the auditor on Christmas Day. Alt5 Sigma said it appointed L J Soldinger Associates, LLC its new auditor.</p>\n\n<p>Alt5 Sigma earlier told the Financial Times that Victor Mokuolo CPA PLLC was undergoing a peer review under the Texas State Board of Accountancy regulations, which was due to be completed in January 2026. The audit firm received a failing grade under the peer review process in 2023, and has received fines from the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board for reporting failures in 2023 and 2024.</p>",

JPMorgan said the freeze on the stablecoin companies’ accounts was not because of the nature of the businesses. “This has nothing to do with stablecoin companies,” a spokesperson for the bank said. “We bank both stablecoin issuers and stablecoin-related businesses, and we recently took a stablecoin issuer public.” The bank otherwise declined to comment on the matter.</p>",

The companies didn’t disclose financial details but Nvidia said the deal is structured as a nonexclusive licensing arrangement rather than an outright acquisition, a tactic that may help the world’s most valuable company avoid immediate regulatory review. This follows a pattern of Nvidia using its financial might to cement its market position, including a similar, smaller licensing-and-hiring deal with networking startup Enfabrica.</p>\n\n<p>The Groq move gives Nvidia access to intellectual property for chips that process data faster for specific AI inference tasks, potentially allowing Nvidia to design server chips that are cheaper and more efficient for running AI applications compared to its current general-purpose graphics processing units. Groq’s chips aim to&nbsp;keep data on the processor itself&nbsp;rather than shuttling it back and forth to separate high-bandwidth memory chips, whereas Nvidia chips rely&nbsp;more heavily on HBM chips. That reliance exposes Nvidia to a memory supply chain controlled by a handful of firms.</p>\n\n<p>The Groq deal underscores the immense difficulty AI chip startups face in challenging Nvidia’s market dominance, even with billions in venture funding. Groq, for instance, recently had to slash its 2025 revenue projections by about 75%. It was recently valued at $6.9 billion in an equity funding, which explains why the $20 billion deal with Nvidia sent shockwaves across the business world.</p>",

Those tariffs will stay at zero for the next 18 months, giving American companies a grace period before costs rise.</p>\n\n<p>The decision to hold off on imposing the chip tariffs shows how the administration is trying to avoid exacerbating tensions with Beijing, after President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping reached a truce in the trade war earlier this year. After China threatened to restrict exports of rare earth metals, the U.S. moved to ease tensions. As part of the negotiations, the U.S. also postponed other tech export restrictions.</p>\n\n<p>The chip tariffs stem from a yearlong investigation known as Section 301 that concluded China has been pouring billions of dollars in state subsidies into chipmaking plants to dominate the global market for less advanced legacy chips and undercut foreign competitors. While U.S .companies like Nvidia dominate the market for cutting-edge AI chips, China is supplying huge volumes of older chips that power home appliances and cars.</p>\n\n<p>For American companies, the 18-month window means they have more time for renegotiating contracts and finding new chip suppliers. The administration is also conducting a broader national security probe that could hit semiconductors from all countries.</p>",
