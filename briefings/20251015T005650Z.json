Under the renewed deal, WPP will spend $400 million on Google’s technologies. WPP uses Google’s AI particularly in its WPP Open product, an AI platform for marketers.</p>\n\n<p>WPP and Google first announced a partnership in April 2024. The renewed arrangement allows the two companies to co-develop products together and then take them to market, said Stephan Pretorius, chief technology officer at WPP. WPP can also get early access to Google DeepMind’s research.</p>\n\n<p>“I think a year and a half ago, the stuff that we were doing with generative AI models was all ideation,” Pretorius said. “We now are creating an enormous amount of content that is actually being used in market with AI.”</p>\n\n<p>Pretorius said that their staff is using generative AI regularly. Earlier this year, when Google released its Veo2 video generation model, WPP staff had generated four times the expected number of videos.</p>",

The safeguards followed August news reports about a teen who killed himself in April after asking ChatGPT for instructions on suicide. The attorneys general of California and Delaware sent a letter to the company in September, criticizing it for failing to protect teen ChatGPT users.</p>\n\n<p>Altman also said that the company plans to update ChatGPT, which could allow the chatbot to respond with more personality, such as using emojis or being more friendly, if users want it to.</p>",

Salesforce customers will also be able to access Anthropic’s Claude models in a more secure way than they’ve been able to do previously.</p>\n\n<p>Salesforce has had a tough time <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/ai-giving-salesforce-boost?rc=eqgjah\">getting customers to buy its main AI product</a>, Agentforce.

The bank reported record revenue of $15.2 billion in the third quarter, a 20% increase, driven by surging investment banking fees amid rallying stock markets and a more favourable mergers and acquisitions landscape. Goldman Sachs profit rose 37% to $4.1 billion in the quarter.</p>\n\n<p>JPMorgan, which also reported results on Tuesday, reported a 9% increase in third quarter revenues to $46.4 billion. The bank, the largest in the U.S., said net income rose to $14.4 billion, up 12% compared to the same period a year earlier. Citi reported net income rose 15% to $3.8 billion, as revenues rose 9% in the third quarter. Wells Fargo profit increased 9% during the same period to $5.6 billion.

It isn’t clear how much data center power capacity that cluster would require, but it is likely to be a small fraction of a gigawatt.</p>\n\n<p>Last week OpenAI said it would eventually use 6 GW of AMD AI chips to power its technology, and that those chips could be run in cloud providers like Oracle that rent out servers to the ChatGPT maker.

We don’t want to fight, but we are not afraid to fight,” a commerce ministry spokesperson said on Sunday. The U.S. government’s behavior harms China’s interests and undermines the trade talks between the two countries, the spokesperson said.</p>\n\n<p>Trump’s new tariff threat and Beijing’s response indicate a re-escalation of the U.S.-China trade war since the two countries’ high-level negotiations in Spain last month. “If the United States is determined to act alone, China will resolutely take corresponding measures to protect its legitimate rights and interests,” the Chinese ministry spokesperson said.</p>\n\n<p>Trump announced his plan to impose the new tariff against China on Friday, after Beijing announced additional export controls on rare earths and launched an antitrust probe into Qualcomm. In late September, Washington stepped up its effort to block Chinese companies’ access to U.S. technology and suppliers by expanding its trade blacklist.</p>",

Apple has acquired several AI-based security camera companies over the years, including <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-acquires-ai-device-startup-silk-labs\">Silk Labs</a> in 2018 and <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/dde4fe\">Lighthouse AI</a> in 2019. Apple has been working on its own smart home camera for years and is expected to release the product next year, according to analysts and Bloomberg.</p>\n\n<p>The Prompt deal was likely very small, with the startup having only raised a $5 million seed round. The deal continues Apple’s tradition of absorbing smaller technology firms primarily for talent, rather than buying up larger companies. Apple is often wary of larger acquisitions due, in part, to the complexity of integrating big teams into Apple’s unique corporate culture, The Information has previously <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apples-aversion-big-deals-thwart-ai-push\">reported</a>.</p>",
