They were told they could maintain access by buying the service through Alibaba Cloud, according to emails reviewed by The Information.</p>\n\n<p>A Salesforce spokesperson said that “Slack workspace creation and user provisioning are not currently supported in all markets. Our paid customers can provision individual user access for employees working anywhere legally permitted.” Alibaba didn’t reply to a request for comment.</p>\n\n<p>Salesforce and Alibaba announced a <a href=\"https://www.salesforce.com/blog/driving-customer-success-with-alibaba/\">strategic partnership</a> in 2019 in which Alibaba would be the exclusive cloud provider of Salesforce services in these four regions, but that agreement wasn’t put into full practice until the recent days.</p>\n\n<p>Salesforce is the latest U.S. company to separate its Chinese customer service, after Zoom in 2020 and Microsoft’s LinkedIn in 2021 began working with local partners or replaced their services with a local product,&nbsp; underscoring the deepening technological divide between the U.S. and China as companies increasingly operate on separate networks.</p>",

Nvidia said in a regulatory filing that it will pay $1 billion to rent servers in the current fiscal year, $6 billion in both 2027 and 2028, $5 billion in 2029, and $4 billion in both 2030 and 2031. That will make Nvidia one of the world’s biggest cloud spenders and users of GPUs.</p>\n\n<p>Nvidia said it might not use all of the capacity. Nvidia said some of its commitments “may be reduced, terminated or sold to others” by the cloud providers from which it rents servers.</p>\n\n<p>Nvidia’s spending commitment increased even though it has <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/nvidia-steps-back-cloud-effort-compete-aws\">stepped back from its nascent cloud computing business</a> known as DGX Cloud, which aimed to rent out GPUs to business customers. These days, Nvidia uses most of the DGX Cloud server capacity for its own internal efforts, The Information has reported. Earlier this summer, Nvidia launched another kind of cloud service, DGX Cloud Lepton, which helps businesses rent GPUs from various cloud providers.</p>\n\n<p>Nvidia’s cloud commitments includes its <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/nvidia-quietly-boosts-cloud-ally-1-5-billion-deal-rent-ai-chips\">agreement to rent 10,000 of its AI chips</a> back from cloud startup Lambda, The Information first reported. Nvidia also rents its chips from CoreWeave and major cloud providers including Oracle and Amazon.</p>",

            "body": "<p>Nvidia’s revenue rose 62% to $57 billion in the three months ended October compared to the same period a year earlier, largely from sales of AI chips and related equipment. Remarkably, its sales growth accelerated 8 percentage points compared to the July quarter, and Nvidia has projected even faster growth—65.4%—in the current fiscal quarter.</p>\n\n<p>The result could ease fears about investors bidding up prices of AI-related equities too high, relative to the revenue AI is producing for consumers and businesses. It comes after Nvidia’s primary customers, including Microsoft, Meta&nbsp;and Google, increased projected spending on data centers that will use Nvidia chips.&nbsp;Nvidia shares rose 4% in after-hours trading. They were up around 34% this year before the end of normal trading Wednesday.</p>\n\n<p>Shares are trading at nearly 32 times its expected earnings over the next year, down from 36 times forward earnings as of three months ago. That means its shares have been getting cheaper&nbsp;even as its financial position strengthens. Still, four of Nvidia’s customers made up 61% of Nvidia revenue in the October quarter, which was higher percentage than in prior quarters, showing its business carries what&nbsp;investors refer to as&nbsp;concentration risk.</p>\n\n<p>“There’s been a lot of talk about an AI bubble. From our vantage point we see something very different,” CEO Jensen Huang said in a call with analysts. CFO Colette Kress said recent separate data center deals involving Saudi Arabia and AI startup Anthropic would further boost Nvidia growth beyond what it has already projected.</p>\n\n<p>Free cash flow rose 31% to $22.1 billion compared to the year-ago period. The company, which has $60 billion in cash, has been spending more than $12 billion a quarter buying back its own stock while it also spends generously to fund dozens of AI startups and data centers, which will end up boosting its sales in the long run.</p>\n\n<p>Nvidia’s recent revenue growth looks particularly impressive compared to its distant rival AMD, which reported 36% revenue growth in the September quarter, and also in spite of Nvidia getting squeezed out of the Chinese market, which until recently was&nbsp;a substantial part of its business. In addition to chips, Nvidia’s sale of networking equipment that connect servers to each other continued to accelerate in the October quarter, generating more than $8 billion of revenue.</p>",

By keeping transactions in its app, Target can maintain more control over the shopper experience, a key concern for many large retailers, and also preserve its access to shopper data and ad revenue.

Anthropic has primarily relied on cloud servers from those two firms to run its models. Anthropic said in a statement that “Amazon remains Anthropic’s primary cloud provider and training partner.”</p>\n\n<p>The deals show how Microsoft is deepening its ties with OpenAI’s archrival after amending its deal with OpenAI earlier this year. Microsoft, which has invested $13 billion in OpenAI, has the rights to reuse OpenAI’s models in its own products and OpenAI has committed to spend more than $250 billion to rent Azure servers in the coming years.</p>\n\n<p>Microsoft earlier this year <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/microsoft-buy-ai-anthropic-shift-openai?rc=geicgp\">started paying Anthropic</a> to use its models in its products, in addition to those from OpenAI. Unlike its deal with OpenAI, Microsoft’s investment with Anthropic doesn’t grant Microsoft intellectual property rights over Anthropic’s models, according to a company spokesperson.</p>\n\n<p>“As an industry we need to move beyond any zero sum narrative or winner-take-all hype,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a video announcing the Anthropic deal. “The opportunity is simply too big to approach any other way.”</p>\n\n<p>Anthropic’s initial $30 billion commitment will pay for roughly one gigawatt of Azure servers&nbsp; equipped with Nvidia’s NVIDIA Grace Blackwell and Vera Rubin chips, according to an Nvidia spokesperson. In addition, Microsoft said that Anthropic will contract up to an additional gigawatt of server capacity from Azure over an unspecified time period. A Microsoft spokesperson declined to comment on whether Microsoft plans to build additional data centers to provide Anthropic with that capacity. One gigawatt of capacity <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/sam-altman-wants-250-gigawatts-power-possible?rc=geicgp\">typically costs cloud providers</a> around $50 billion to build.</p>",
