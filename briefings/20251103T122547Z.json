Asked for more details, Musk said: “Well you know my friend Peter Thiel once reflected that the future was supposed to have flying cars but we don’t have flying cars.” Pressed by Rogan for more details, Musk added, “I think if Peter wants a flying car we should be able to buy one.”</p>\n\n<p>Musk dodged further questions from Rogan but said the prototype had “some crazy technology” and its unveiling would be “unforgettable.” He also described the car by saying, “If you took all the James Bond cars and combined them, it’s crazier than that.” Musk said the new Roadster would be a different design than previous prototypes of the vehicle that Tesla has shared publicly. Musk has previously teased a flying Roadster, including in a July 2024 appearance at a Tesla fan event and in Tesla’s October 2024 earnings call. Tesla manufactured the original Roadster from 2008 to 2012 before focusing on other models. A new version of the car was due to start production in 2020 but has been repeatedly delayed.</p>",

NBCU reported the same subscriber number for the first half of&nbsp;the year.</p>\n\n<p>Comcast president Michael Cavanagh noted on an analyst call that Peacock’s momentum was “solid,” noting that subscriber retention had been steady despite a price increase earlier this year.</p>\n\n<p>Peacock’s revenue fell 9.9% to $1.36 billion in the quarter compared with the year-earlier period, when the results were boosted by the Paris Olympics, NBCU said. That was&nbsp;presumably a reference to increased advertising attached to Olympics programming. NBCUniversal said that excluding the Olympics, Peacock’s revenue grew “at a mid-teens rate.” Peacock is losing less money: its losses fell by about half in the third quarter.</p>",
