            "body": "<p>China’s tech giant Huawei Technologies and its manufacturing partner Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. have made some progress in chip production, but their products still lag far behind industry leaders, according to a teardown by research firm TechInsights last Thursday.</p>\n\n<p>The companies’ latest achievement is the Kirin 9030 processor, which powers Huawei’s Mate 80 Pro Max smartphone released last month. It represents China’s most advanced homegrown semiconductor manufacturing to date, achieved despite years of U.S. export control that has cut off the country’s access to cutting-edge chipmaking equipment.</p>\n\n<p>But the chip still falls significantly short of the industry-leading manufacturing technology used by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and South Korea’s Samsung Electronics, according to TechInsights’ teardown report. The production method is also likely struggling with yield issues, which means the vast majority of chips produced didn’t work properly, according to TechInsights. That’s because SMIC had to rely on older, less precise equipment to repeat certain chipmaking processes to create denser patterns on chips, the report showed.</p>\n\n<p>The development indicates that China continues to find ways to advance its domestic chip capabilities despite U.S. export restrictions, though the path forward appears increasingly difficult and costly. Huawei and SMIC can still squeeze more performance out of current technology through design innovations and engineering discipline, but the latest TechInsights analysis suggests that they’re approaching the limits of what’s possible without access to the next-generation manufacturing tools.</p>",

But earlier this week the exclusivity period for its letter of intent on the site expired before the companies could reach a final agreement, and the funding deal was terminated, Fermi said.</p>\n\n<p>Fermi said it has begun deal talks with other potential tenants for the data center site, which is expected to be powered in 2026.

            "body": "<p>Wealthfront, an automated investment adviser, said late Thursday it had priced&nbsp;its&nbsp;initial public offering at&nbsp;$14 per share, at the top of the marketed range. At that price it raised $485 million, valuing the company at over $2 billion, or $2.6 billion if all stock options and potential shares were included. That’s&nbsp;a premium to the $1.4 billion the company was valued at in 2022.</p>\n\n<p>Its largest shareholder, Tiger Global Management, invested around $90 million to get its stake of $310 million, netting the firm about $220 million, according to a person familiar with the matter.</p>\n\n<p>The listing should boost cash returns for the New York-based hedge fund, one of the most aggressive venture investors during the pandemic-era startup boom.</p>\n\n<p>Other large shareholders in Wealthfront include DAG Ventures, which owned 12%, Index Ventures which owned 11% and Ribbit Capital, which owned almost 9%, according to securities filings.</p>\n\n<p>The business had raised almost $300 million from investors like Benchmark, Spark Capital and Greylock Partners, dating back to 2007, according to PitchBook Data.</p>\n\n<p>Wealthfront markets itself as a more efficient alternative to a wealth advisor, using technology to automate investment decisions. Its revenue for its most recent fiscal year ending in January was $309 million, up from $217 million the year before. The business is profitable.</p>\n\n<p>The listing comes during a year that has seen a number of financial technology listings, including Chime and Klarna, several of which have been off to a rocky start.</p>\n\n<p>Wealthfront listed on the Nasdaq under the ticker “WLTH.” Goldman Sachs is the lead underwriter on the deal. Fenwick &amp; West and Latham &amp; Watkins served as counsel.</p>\n\n<p>(The story has updated.)</p>",
