            "body": "<p>Chinese startup AgiBot said on Monday that the number of humanoids it has manufactured just reached 5,000, hitting a new milestone in its mass production.</p>\n\n<p>AgiBot’s announcement is the latest example of how Chinese companies are ramping up their production of humanoid robots. Last month, UBTech, another Chinese robot maker, said it had started mass production and delivery of its industrial humanoids. UBTech aims to deliver 500 units by the end of this year.</p>\n\n<p>Shanghai-based AgiBot said its humanoids are currently being used in a variety of industries including entertainment, manufacturing and logistics as well as for scientific research. Apart from a full-size humanoid and a half-size humanoid, the company also sells humanoids designed for complex operations in specific industries.</p>\n\n<p>AgiBot was founded in 2023 by Zhihui Peng, a former member of Huawei Technologies’ “Genius Youth” program. It is one of a growing number of Chinese startups that are racing to develop more capable humanoids by taking advantage of the country’s vast hardware supply chain and deep talent pool in AI and advanced robotics.</p>",

In recent years, Confluent has touted its software’s ability to give AI models access to fresh data, and OpenAI has used Confluent’s software to analyze how customers are using ChatGPT and other products.</p>\n\n<p>But Confluent’s sales growth has been slowing due to increasing competition and customers getting better at controlling their cloud spending, and the company had reportedly been exploring a sale after receiving takeover interest two months ago.</p>\n\n<p>Confluent, which manages the open source Apache Kafka software, would be a logical fit for IBM, which acquired Red Hat in 2019 for $34.5 billion—the largest software deal in history—as well as&nbsp;cloud management tool provider&nbsp;HashiCorp last year. If the Confluent deal happens, it would mark one of IBM’s biggest acquisitions in recent years as it pivots further into software, cloud and AI under CEO Arvind Krishna.</p>",

In September, Mehta released his preliminary judgment on remedies, which required that Google stop exclusive search distribution contracts and mandated some data sharing with search engine rivals but avoided the most extreme remedies such as forcing a sale of Chrome that plaintiffs led by the Department of Justice had requested.</p>\n\n<p>After the September judgment, <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/antitrust-judge-bars-google-exclusive-deals-require-chrome-sale?rc=n9lbpq\">viewed</a> by antitrust experts as a positive outcome for the search company, Google and the Department of Justice filed separate <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/google-justice-department-file-dueling-remedies-proposals-antitrust-search-case?rc=n9lbpq\">proposals</a> dueling over how to interpret the judge’s ruling. Friday’s final judgment hewed more closely to the government’s proposal, including Mehta’s decision on generative AI products. The judge also ruled that Google must renegotiate any contracts for search or generative AI defaults every year, and that agreements with Apple have to be device-by-device and access point by access point.</p>\n\n<p>Google and the Department of Justice did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Google previously said that it would appeal Mehta’s initial finding of the illegal monopoly, and the Department of Justice said after Mehta’s remedies ruling earlier this month that it was considering its options.</p>",

The EU <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_2934\">cited</a> several issues with X’s practices, including the “deceptive design” of X’s blue checkmark system, which the bloc said makes it “difficult for users to judge the authenticity of accounts” and makes it more likely they will fall for scams and manipulation. X has also failed to adequately maintain a database of ads or share information with researchers, which are requirements under the DSA, the EU said.</p>\n\n<p>For Musk, maintaining the X site has been less of a priority this year than growing xAI, his artificial intelligence company, which acquired X in March. Musk has been trying to run X as leanly as possible, including by replacing some staff with xAI’s Grok artificial intelligence model, The Information has <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/twins-pushing-elon-musks-plans-replace-x-staff-grok\">reported</a>. While the EU fine is smaller than previous EU fines against American tech firms, it is almost certain to inflame tensions between the U.S. and EU. On Thursday, U.S. Vice President JD Vance <a href=\"https://x.com/JDVance/status/1996701953372704921\">wrote</a> on X that the “EU should be supporting free speech not attacking American companies over garbage.”</p>",

The Information reproduced some of the results Thursday.</p>\n\n<p>Enterprise AI startup Sierra, privately valued at $10 billion, powered the chatbot for Gap. Rachel Whetstone, head of communications at Sierra, which was co-founded by former Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor, said the issue stemmed from a coordinated effort to trick its customers’ chatbots to respond to inappropriate questions.</p>\n\n<p>“Since last week, a bad actor has been attempting to maliciously jailbreak over a dozen of our customers’ AI agents,” Whetstone said in a statement. “There have been multiple attempts, and it appears our built-in abuse detection system has intercepted all of them except for Gap, where we’d inadvertently misconfigured the agent’s guardrails. These controls have now been properly configured, and the agent remains live. We sincerely apologize to Gap.”</p>\n\n<p>It isn’t clear how many Gap customers engaged in off-color topics with the assistant, and Gap spokespeople didn’t respond to requests for comment.</p>\n\n<p>The episode is another example of AI chatbots and agents being a work in progress. In July, for instance, Elon Musk’s xAI <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/elon-musks-xai-apologies-horrific-behavior?rc=eqgjah\">apologized</a> after its AI chatbot, Grok, made a series of X posts in praise of Adolf Hitler.</p>",
