The visit coincided with Apple’s announcement that it finally received approval to release iPhone Air in the country.</p>\n\n<p>Cook <a href=\"https://english.news.cn/20251015/7f968d9d1a8d4c57830c51c85d9acefb/c.html\">pledged</a> in meetings with Chinese officials that Apple would continue to invest in China and help accelerate the country’s economic development. His visit comes as Apple shifts iPhone production out of China to India to avoid being caught in the middle of an escalating trade war between the U.S. and China.</p>\n\n<p>Separately, Apple COO Sabih Khan visited several Chinese-owned Apple suppliers including Lens Technology, which makes the iPhone’s glass screens, the Chinese financial news outlet Yicai <a href=\"https://www.yicaiglobal.com/news/apples-suppliers-in-china-set-up-usd140-million-clean-energy-fund\">reported</a>.</p>",

The previously unreported data show Oracle has a wide gap to fill to reach what co-CEO Clay Magouyrk said Thursday would be 30% to 40% gross margins from the AI cloud business in the coming years.</p>\n\n<p>The company also increased its revenue projection for its cloud business in fiscal 2030 to an astounding $166&nbsp;billion, up 15% from a projection it made a month ago. The company is reinventing itself as a cloud provider, and its margin projections suggest it will find ways to lower the cost of chips it buys from Nvidia or will be able to charge customers such as OpenAI more to rent the chips. Internal data also show the company is losing money on rentals of the newest Nvidia chips, Blackwell, as well as on chips from AMD that came out last year, <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/oracle-assures-investors-ai-cloud-margins-struggles-profit-older-nvidia-chips?rc=c48ukx\">the report said</a>.</p>",

            "body": "<p>Microsoft is adding new AI features to its forthcoming Windows 11 operating system that will let users speak to their computer to automate tasks like locating and editing files, organizing tabs, or managing calendar events, the company announced on Thursday.</p>\n\n<p>The new push comes as Microsoft aims to convince more consumers to use its AI Copilot features, which are primarily powered by models from OpenAI. Microsoft previously only offered most of the AI features to people who bought one of its so-called Copilot+ PCs built with more heavy-duty chips meant for running AI, but the new Windows 11 update will make the features available for all users in the coming months. Microsoft is ending support for Windows 10 this month, which will lead to a surge of people upgrading to the new operating system.</p>\n\n<p>With the new update, users will be able to “wake” the AI by saying “Hey, Copilot” out loud, or by typing prompts into a Copilot tab at the bottom of their screen, just as people wake virtual assistants from Google, Amazon and Apple. In addition to acting as a general-purpose chatbot similar to ChatGPT, Copilot can automatically take actions on people’s PCs, such as closing applications that are using up a lot of memory, adjusting system settings, or searching through files.</p>\n\n<p>Microsoft isn’t the only software firm trying to make AI features stick on people’s computer operating systems—Apple recently announced similar AI features earlier this year, but most of those have yet to arrive in its latest MacOS update, and the company’s development of AI features has been <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-losing-ground-ai-talent-war-just-money?rc=geicgp\">plagued by setbacks</a>.</p>",

The partnership is aiming to invest $30 billion of equity and up to $100 billion total, including debt, in data center and power assets.</p>\n\n<p>The investor group is buying Aligned from Macquarie Asset Management, which first invested in the business in 2018.

The bank is planning to serve technology companies and high-net-worth individuals that use cryptocurrencies, the OCC said.</p>\n\n<p>According to the conditional approval letter, Erebor is led by Owen Rapaport, the co-founder of crypto monitoring company Aer Compliance.
