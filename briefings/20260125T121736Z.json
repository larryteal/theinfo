OpenAI leaders recently teased upcoming upgrades to the startup’s AI coding tool, Codex, which they said would soon surpass Claude Code’s performance and features.</p>\n\n<p>OpenAI is aiming to counter the inroads rival Anthropic has made with large companies due to the surging popularity of its AI coding product, Claude Code. One question is whether OpenAI can gain the trust of large companies that see Anthropic as a safer path to adopting AI because it is primarily targeting business customers.</p>",

Epic would pay $800 million to Google over six years for services associated with the deal, which may be tied to the services agreement.</p>\n\n<p>Donato asked whether the deal could constitute a “quid pro quo” incentivizing Epic to soften its demands for terms favoring other Android developers, The Verge reported. The current settlement, which Epic supports, would require Google to reduce its app store fees and make it easier to download alternative app stores. Epic CEO Tim Sweeney pushed back on the judge’s assessment, according to the Verge, noting that Epic was paying Google, not the other way around.</p>",

In recent weeks, prosecutors have distributed subpoenas for a grand jury, the Journal reported.</p>\n\n<p>Detectives from the Anti-Bribery and Corruption Unit of Ireland’s Garda National Economic Crime Bureau recently searched the home of Keith O’Brien, the alleged spy, according to a report by <a href=\"https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/courts/us-justice-department-opens-probe-in-alleged-corporate-spy-plot-involving-irish-executive/a1757789873.html\">The Irish Independent</a> on Friday. Garda Headquarters said the search was “part of an ongoing criminal investigation into alleged corruption and money laundering involving an international software company,” according to the report.</p>\n\n<p>A spokesperson for Deel said the company was&nbsp;not aware of any investigation. “We will always cooperate with the relevant authorities and provide any necessary information in response to valid inquiries,” Deel said.</p>\n\n<p>Court filings that were unsealed in November, in a civil lawsuit Rippling launched against Deel, showed Deel labeled as an expense a $6,000 payment it made to the wife of the company’s chief operating officer. That cash was immediately sent to O’Brien. Deel has denied Rippling’s civil suit allegations and launched a separate defamation case against its rival. A Deel spokesperson said its lawsuit shows Rippling made misleading claims about Deel, including in a separate civil case in Florida that&nbsp;was recently dismissed. That lawsuit,&nbsp;backed by a Rippling investor and lawyer, alleged lapses in Deel’s compliance controls.</p>\n\n<p>In November, Deel CEO Alex Bouaziz added Morrison Foerster partner William Frentzen, a&nbsp;former DOJ lawyer, to his legal team. Bouaziz also recently credited Andreessen Horowitz, which holds a multi-billion dollar stake in Deel, for helping to manage the fallout from Rippling’s allegations. Bouaziz told substack publication <a href=\"https://www.notboring.co/p/a16z-the-power-brokers\">Not Boring</a>, that the venture firm was “figuring things out, helping me figure out how to manage it, getting the best people to help, getting their own hands dirty.

In October, Amazon announced it was laying off 14,000 employees to help reduce management layers and bureaucracy.</p>\n\n<p>The upcoming layoffs will affect roughly the same number of employees as those in October, bringing the total number of laid off employees to as many as 30,000, Reuters reported. Affected units include Amazon Web Services, Prime Video, retail and human resources, the report said.</p>\n\n<p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/amazon-ceo-weighs-ai-shopping-wars-openai-relationship\">told</a> The Information in an interview at Davos earlier this week that layoffs at Amazon aren’t about AI replacing human workers, but about improving the company’s culture after adding lots of employees in recent years. “Where we see layers stripping ownership, we’re going to try and take those layers away and we’re going to try and flatten it,” he said.</p>",

The law had required TikTok’s U.S. operations to sever its ties with its Chinese parent ByteDance or face a ban.</p>\n\n<p>The deal, blessed by President Trump last September, doesn’t entirely sever TikTok from ByteDance. As previously reported, and confirmed in today’s announcement, the joint venture will oversee the protection of TikTok’s U.S. user data, the security of the algorithm that governs what people see on the app and oversee content moderation. TikTok’s business—the sale of advertising and the running of TikTok Shop—remains part of ByteDance.</p>\n\n<p>Thursday’s announcement named the board members for the new joint venture. They include TikTok CEO Shou Chew, as well as Mark Dooley, a representative&nbsp;of ByteDance investors Susquehanna International Group, as well as Silver Lake co-CEO Egon Durban, former TPG Global executive Timothy Dattels, Oracle executive Ken Glueck and MGX executive David Scott. As expected, TikTok executive Adam Presser will run the joint venture, confirming an earlier report by The Information.</p>\n\n<p>TikTok also revealed the identity of other investors, including Michael Dell, affiliates of ByteDance investors&nbsp;Susquehanna and&nbsp;General Atlantic, as well as a Yuri Milner and&nbsp;Xavier Niel, a French entrepreneur and a ByteDance board member. ByteDance keeps 19.9% of the venture.</p>",

The move in Austin is a key initial step toward catching up with Alphabet’s Waymo, which offers autonomous rides to customers without backup humans in more than 2,000 vehicles across six U.S. cities.</p>\n\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://x.com/aelluswamy/status/2014398853991301538\">post on X</a>, Tesla’s vice president of autopilot and AI software Ashok Elluswamy said Tesla was “starting with a few unsupervised vehicles mixed in with the broader robotaxi fleet with safety monitors” and that the “ratio will increase over time.” Elluswamy did not say when Tesla plans to fully remove humans from Robotaxi vehicles in Austin or start doing so in any other cities. Tesla shares were up about 4% Thursday afternoon.</p>\n\n<p>Tesla has blown through deadlines that Elon Musk announced for Robotaxi. Musk said in July that Robotaxi would be available to half the U.S. population by the end of 2025, “subject to regulatory approvals.” In October, Musk scaled back that target to eight to 10 U.S. metro areas and said that the company would remove backup supervisors in Austin by the end of the year. But the service is still only available in Austin and the San Francisco Bay Area. In California, Tesla is offering Robotaxi rides with humans in the driver’s seat and is <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/teslas-scaled-back-robotaxi-timeline-still-faces-obstacles\">operating under a permit</a> that only allows a human driver to drive a traditional vehicle, making the removal of humans more difficult than in Texas.</p>",
