If Celestial AI reaches certain revenue milestones by 2029, Marvell would also pay Celestial’s current shareholders an additional $2.25 billion in stock, which would bring the total deal value to more than $5.5 billion. The Information reported that the total deal price, including earnouts, exceeded $5 billion.</p>\n\n<p>A deal with Celestial could help Marvell build out its data center offerings. Celestial AI, last valued at $2.5 billion in a March fundraising, develops an optical interconnect technology, which uses laser light instead of electrical signals to more efficiently move data between AI processors and memory inside data centers.</p>\n\n<p>Marvell expects Celestial to generate meaningful revenue and said it could reach a $1 billion dollar run rate by the fourth quarter of fiscal 2029.</p>",

That increase is likely affected by tariffs, which have driven many merchants to hike their prices, as well as overall inflation. Shopify said the top-selling product categories included cosmetics, apparel and fitness and nutrition items. About one third of orders placed on Shopify sites were made using Shop Pay, Shopify’s one-click checkout that has become a key selling point of its e-commerce software. That figure is a 39% increase from last year, the company said.</p>\n\n<p>The sales increases were despite an outage to some Shopify systems on Cyber Monday that left some merchants unable to log in or access their point-of-sale and other backend systems.

These centers would generally be smaller than 10,000 square feet and centrally located in urban areas, according to planning permits.</p>\n\n<p>The offering could boost Amazon’s business selling what it calls “everyday essentials”—items like groceries and household products—which has emerged as a critically important category for the company over the past few years under <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/amazon-retail-chief-shifts-culture-toward-lower-costs-gasp-slower-shipping?rc=d8mrkd\">Amazon’s retail chief, Doug Herrington</a>.

Apple delayed the release earlier this year and is now promising a new-and-improved Siri next year.</p>\n\n<p>Under a new structure for its AI leadership, Subramanya won’t report directly to CEO Tim Cook, as Giannandrea did. Instead, Subramanya will report to Apple’s software leader Craig Federighi, who already took over Siri earlier this year. Other parts of the AI group that were overseen by Giannandrea will shift to chief operating officer Sabih Khan and Apple services executive Eddy Cue “to align closer with similar organizations,” Apple said.</p>\n\n<p>Subramanya spent 16 years at Google, where he headed up engineering for Gemini Assistant near the end of his time.

The lawsuit earlier this month alleged Amyot stole confidential information to launch a competing firm. The threat of a potential whistleblower complaint potentially adds to the legal woes facing Alt5 since the deal with the Trumps triggered a series of executive departures and regulatory disclosures.</p>\n\n<p>In August, Alt5, a largely-unknown Nasdaq-listed company, struck a $1.5 billion deal with World Liberty, a crypto company co-founded by the President’s two eldest sons, Eric and Donald Jr., to use Alt5 as a vehicle to amass a store of World Liberty’s crypto token, $WLFI. World Liberty co-founder Zach Witkoff—the son of President Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff—was appointed Alt5’s chair as part of the deal.</p>\n\n<p>Shares in Alt5 have tumbled about 75% to around $1.87 since the deal after the company issued new shares and warrants to buy the crypto token and disclosed possible legal and regulatory problems, including a conviction for alleged money laundering in Rwanda. Alt5 in September told staff it suspended its CEO in September pending the outcome of an investigation into the company by a new outside law firm. Several other senior executives have quit or have been fired.</p>\n\n<p>Amyot alleged he personally retained almost 100 documents from his Alt5 email account in September after he stopped working for the company because the documents&nbsp;related to conversations with the firm’s former chief executive Peter Tassiopoulos and were “preserved for use in a potential SEC whistleblower complaint,” according to a declaration he filed in a Delaware court this week. Amyot said he “was also a vocal critic of the $1.5 billion transaction done with World Liberty Financial” and that the lawsuit against him was “filed in retaliation to my vocal criticism.” A World Liberty spokesperson declined to comment.</p>",
