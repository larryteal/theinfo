China’s access to high-end AI chips from firms such as Nvidia remains a sticking point in China-U.S. relations.</p>",

Bolte said he had expected it to be easy to raise $10 million to $15 million to continue the company, but those efforts failed.</p>\n\n<p>The company had raised about $4 million at a $50 million valuation in a seed funding round in February led by venture firm Fellows Fund. Investors Nat Friedman and Daniel Gross also invested $250,000 in the startup in April 2024.</p>\n\n<p>K-Scale <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/open-source-robotics-startup-caught-openais-eye\">developed a humanoid robot</a> that walked on two legs and used open-source software. Staff from tech giants such as OpenAI, Nvidia and Amazon had visited the young startup’s operations in a house near Stanford University to view its robots. K-Scale had about 10 employees, but many of the key employees departed in recent months as funding ran out.</p>\n\n<p>Bolte said in the email he discussed the possibility of humanoid maker 1X Technologies acquiring K-Scale with CEO Bernt Børnich, but Børnich “made it clear to me that he was only interested in acquiring a small number of team members from K-Scale, and none of the other company assets,” Bolte wrote. He said he had a similar conversation with staff at robotics maker The Bot Co. A spokesperson for 1X declined to comment and The Bot Co. did not respond to a request for comment.</p>\n\n<p>Bolte also shared a note with K-Scale’s Discord server, saying that pre-ordered robots would not be fulfilled and deposits for them would be refunded. Ten prototypes were manufactured, and over 100 others were ordered, according to a former K-Scale employee. OpenAI’s robotics lead Caitlin Kalinowski ordered one of K-Scale’s robots, said Bolte. The robots were priced around $15,000 each, and the company had received over $2 million in orders, he said.</p>",

It said Comet’s AI assistant offered&nbsp;a “significantly degraded shopping and customer service experience.”</p>\n\n<p>The skirmish is one of the highest-profile examples yet of the tension between AI companies developing agents and other tools that can complete tasks like making purchases on behalf of users and retailers that want to more closely control shoppers’ experiences on their sites.</p>\n\n<p>“We think it’s fairly straightforward that third-party applications that offer to make purchases on behalf of customers from other businesses should operate openly and respect service provider decisions whether or not to participate,” Amazon said in a statement.</p>\n\n<p>Amazon has previously taken steps to ward off AI agents and bots from accessing its site. This summer, Amazon <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/amazon-locks-googles-ai-shopping-agents\">updated the code underpinning its website</a> to add language warding off AI agents from Google, in addition to restrictions on AI crawlers and agents from Perplexity, Anthropic’s Claude and OpenAI’s ChatGPT. The e-commerce giant is working on several of its own agentic shopping tools, including a feature called Buy For Me, which can make purchases on outside sites on behalf of Amazon users, and its on-site chatbot Rufus, which can answer questions about products and help users decide what to purchase. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said on the company’s earnings call last week that while most existing agentic shopping tools didn’t currently have good customer experiences, he expected that Amazon would eventually find ways to partner with outside AI agents.</p>",

Botha said he will transition to a new role advising the partnership while continuing to serve on the firm’s boards.</p>\n\n<p>The announcement is unusual because Botha, age 52, only took the firm’s top, global role in mid 2022. Previous leaders of the firm, including founder Doug Leone and Mike Moritz, held the most senior roles for more than a decade each. Botha had led the firm’s U.S. operations since 2017.</p>\n\n<p>Botha didn’t give a reason for the change except to note that it was time for him to transition to the next generation. Prior to Botha’s departure, some Sequoia partners had concerns about his management style, according to two people with knowledge of the discussions, though it’s not clear that those concerns directly led to the decision.</p>\n\n<p>The announcement shook up the staff, some of whom became visibly upset during a company meeting to discuss the decision, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.</p>\n\n<p>In the last two years, Botha managed through a period of intense competition among VC firms to win AI deals as well as increasing political polarization in tech.</p>\n\n<p>Last month, Sequoia Capital’s former chief operating officer, Sumaiya Balbale, resigned from her job after Maguire made posts on X she considered Islamophobic, according to the Financial Times. Botha has defended Maguire and has described Sequoia’s stance on politics as “institutional neutrality.”</p>\n\n<p>Botha joined the firm in 2003 after taking PayPal through its initial public offering as its chief financial officer. At Sequoia, he invested in YouTube shortly after its founding, gaming company Unity, Block (then called Square), MongoDB and Instagram.</p>\n\n<p>(This article has been updated with details on Botha’s departure.)</p>",
