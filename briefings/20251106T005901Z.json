The AI startup will pay Snap $400 million over one year, through a combination of cash and equity, to add its AI-powered answer engine to Snapchat, which reaches 943 million monthly active users, the companies announced.</p>\n\n<p>The feature will come online next year, and Snap will consider partnerships with other chatbot firms, CEO Evan Spiegel said. Also on the call, Spiegel revealed that it was putting its forthcoming&nbsp; Spectacles into a separate fully owned subsidiary which would “give us some options as we think about potential partners to work with to accelerate our leadership,” Spiegel said. The Information reported earlier this year that Snap was considering spinning out the spectacles into a separate unit to allow it to raise outside money, just as Alphabet has done with Waymo.</p>\n\n<p>While Snap’s revenue growth was stronger than the last quarter, the company is still growing much more slowly than peers like Pinterest and Reddit. In the quarter, Snap’s ad revenue grew only 5% , while revenue in North America, typically the region with the highest paying advertisers, grew&nbsp;by only 1%.</p>",

            "body": "<p>Amazon escalated its legal battle against Perplexity with a lawsuit filed late Tuesday, as the e-commerce giant seeks to block the AI search startup from accessing Amazon’s site with its AI-powered browser, Comet. In the lawsuit, filed in U.S. district court in the Northern District of California, Amazon alleged Perplexity committed computer fraud and violated its terms and conditions.</p>\n\n<p>In the complaint, Amazon said that it had repeatedly asked Perplexity over the course of nearly a year to stop using its AI agents to access its site, and that Perplexity did not comply with its requests. The complaint said that allowing Perplexity’s agents to access Amazon’s site and customer account information would be too risky because of security issues with Comet, and that Perplexity’s agents didn’t provide a good customer experience for shoppers. “Amazon’s claims are without&nbsp;any merit whatsoever,” a Perplexity spokesperson said in a statement. “Amazon has a problem&nbsp;with how its own users want to interact&nbsp;with its site when they choose to use an AI assistant of their choice.”</p>\n\n<p>Amazon said that Perplexity’s agents try to disguise themselves to appear like they are human shoppers visiting Amazon’s site, and that after Amazon implemented a security fix earlier this year that blocked Comet’s access, Perplexity updated Comet with a workaround that would allow it to continue to access Amazon’s site. Amazon said that Perplexity’s continued use of the agents on its site violated its rules that AI agents need to identify themselves appropriately when accessing sites. Amazon also highlighted the issues that agents create for its advertising systems, which it said required Amazon to modify its ad systems in order to filter out agent traffic before billing advertisers.</p>",

The company’s fast revenue growth may encourage investors to back the company again in the coming months. The company would likely target a valuation between $300 billion and $400 billion.</p>\n\n<p>Roughly 80% of Anthropic’s revenue through 2028 comes from sales of its AI models through an application programming interface to business customers. The rest comes from subscriptions to its premium features, including its coding agent Claude Code.</p>\n\n<p>Claude Code is nearing $1 billion in annualized revenue. In total, the company generated close to $7 billion in annualized revenue last month, <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/anthropic-said-target-26-billion-annualized-revenue-2026?rc=8tzurb\">The Information previously reported.</a></p>\n\n<p>In its most optimistic forecasts, Anthropic expects to be cash flow positive as soon as 2027, when it expects to generate $3 billion in cash. The company expects $17 billion in cash the following year. Its gross margins were negative 94% last year but should improve to roughly 50% this year and about 77% in 2028, the company forecasts.</p>",

Bolte said he had expected it to be easy to raise $10 million to $15 million to continue the company, but those efforts failed.</p>\n\n<p>The company had raised about $4 million at a $50 million valuation in a seed funding round in February led by venture firm Fellows Fund. Investors Nat Friedman and Daniel Gross also invested $250,000 in the startup in April 2024.</p>\n\n<p>K-Scale <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/open-source-robotics-startup-caught-openais-eye\">developed a humanoid robot</a> that walked on two legs and used open-source software. Staff from tech giants such as OpenAI, Nvidia and Amazon had visited the young startup’s operations in a house near Stanford University to view its robots. K-Scale had about 10 employees, but many of the key employees departed in recent months as funding ran out.</p>\n\n<p>Bolte said in the email he discussed the possibility of humanoid maker 1X Technologies acquiring K-Scale with CEO Bernt Børnich, but Børnich “made it clear to me that he was only interested in acquiring a small number of team members from K-Scale, and none of the other company assets,” Bolte wrote. He said he had a similar conversation with staff at robotics maker The Bot Co. A spokesperson for 1X declined to comment and The Bot Co. did not respond to a request for comment.</p>\n\n<p>Bolte also shared a note with K-Scale’s Discord server, saying that pre-ordered robots would not be fulfilled and deposits for them would be refunded. Ten prototypes were manufactured, and over 100 others were ordered, according to a former K-Scale employee. OpenAI’s robotics lead Caitlin Kalinowski ordered one of K-Scale’s robots, said Bolte. The robots were priced around $15,000 each, and the company had received over $2 million in orders, he said.</p>",

This summer, Amazon <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/amazon-locks-googles-ai-shopping-agents\">updated the code underpinning its website</a> to add language warding off AI agents from Google, in addition to restrictions on AI crawlers and agents from Perplexity, Anthropic’s Claude and OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

Botha said he will transition to a new role advising the partnership while continuing to serve on the firm’s boards.</p>\n\n<p>The announcement is unusual because Botha, age 52, only took the firm’s top, global role in mid 2022. Previous leaders of the firm, including founder Doug Leone and Mike Moritz, held the most senior roles for more than a decade each. Botha had led the firm’s U.S. operations since 2017.</p>\n\n<p>Botha didn’t give a reason for the change except to note that it was time for him to transition to the next generation. Prior to Botha’s departure, some Sequoia partners had concerns about his management style, according to two people with knowledge of the discussions, though it’s not clear that those concerns directly led to the decision.</p>\n\n<p>The announcement shook up the staff, some of whom became visibly upset during a company meeting to discuss the decision, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.</p>\n\n<p>In the last two years, Botha managed through a period of intense competition among VC firms to win AI deals as well as increasing political polarization in tech.</p>\n\n<p>Last month, Sequoia Capital’s former chief operating officer, Sumaiya Balbale, resigned from her job after Maguire made posts on X she considered Islamophobic, according to the Financial Times. Botha has defended Maguire and has described Sequoia’s stance on politics as “institutional neutrality.”</p>\n\n<p>Botha joined the firm in 2003 after taking PayPal through its initial public offering as its chief financial officer. At Sequoia, he invested in YouTube shortly after its founding, gaming company Unity, Block (then called Square), MongoDB and Instagram.</p>\n\n<p>(This article has been updated with details on Botha’s departure.)</p>",

For the current quarter, which includes the all-important holiday shopping season for retailers, Shopify projected revenue growth in the mid-to-high twenties and for its free cash flow margin to be slightly higher than the third quarter.</p>\n\n<p>Shopify has been trying to win over more large retailers as customers for the past few years, though Hoffmeister said that in the third quarter, merchants with annual sales below $25 million still generated the “significant majority” of Shopify’s gross merchandise volume.
