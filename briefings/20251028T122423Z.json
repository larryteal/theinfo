In Shanghai, Seres has a market capitalization of around $36 billion.</p>\n\n<p>Driven by a surge in tech stocks including EV makers, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index has gained more than 30% since the beginning of this year. For example, major EV maker Xpeng’s Hong Kong-listed stock is up more than 90% year to date, while another competitor Nio’s stock has risen nearly 60%.</p>\n\n<p>In the filing submitted on Monday, Seres said it expects to receive net proceeds of about $1.66 billion from the offering, and plans to use the majority of the proceeds to invest in research and development.</p>",

It is one of a growing number of Chinese startups that are racing to develop more capable humanoids by taking advantage of the country’s vast hardware supply chain and deep talent pool in AI and advanced robotics.
