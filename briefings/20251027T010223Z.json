Midha, who previously helped Andreessen startups access Nvidia GPUs, will remain a part-time venture partner, retaining board seats on companies like Mistral and Black Forest Labs.</p>\n\n<p>Midha’s new venture highlights the increasing demand for compute power among AI startups. At Andreessen, he led Oxygen, a group that managed thousands of Nvidia chips for rent to startups, which helped the firm secure competitive investments.</p>\n\n<p>Andreessen is one of the few VC firms that rent or buy GPUs to then rent to their backed startups, a practice some firms avoid due to management overhead and hardware depreciation concerns. The firm’s program began with plans for over 20,000 chips and has since expanded to multiple private clusters.</p>",

In a recent interview with The New York Times, Benioff praised Trump and said he supported deploying National Guard troops in San Francisco. The comments sparked backlash and led prominent Silicon Valley venture capitalist Ron Conway to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/16/us/salesforce-resign-benioff-ron-conway.html\">resign from the board of Salesforce’s philanthropic arm</a>. Benioff later <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/17/us/benioff-apologizes-san-francisco.html\">apologized for the comments</a> but not before the Times published a separate report revealing that Salesforce had&nbsp;been&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/16/us/salesforce-benioff-ice.html\">pitching</a>&nbsp;Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for government contracts.</p>",

Its new valuation, of more than $6 billion, is 20% higher than its last fundraising in 2023.</p>\n\n<p>The funding, led by Palo Alto, Calif-based Eclipse Ventures and Nvidia venture arm NVentures, illustrates how stationary storage batteries have emerged as a bright spot as many Western Western battery startups are strapped for cash and some have <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/the-electric-northvolts-blunt-message-to-fellow-battery-startups-dont-expect-a-bailout?utm_source=ti_app&rc=fd9gxc\">gone bankrupt</a>. The round comes two weeks after Texas residential stationary battery maker Base Power, co-founded by entrepreneur Zach Dell, <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/home-battery-startup-base-power-plots-4-billion-valuation?rc=fd9gxc\">raised $1 billion</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Tesla co-founder JB Straubel founded Redwood in 2017 to recycle defective and dead lithium-ion batteries and sell the resulting metals back to customers like GM, Panasonic and Toyota to be turned again into batteries. With the electric vehicle industry taking off slowly, Redwood later broadened its business lines into making cathodes, the costliest component in a battery.</p>\n\n<p>Then, in July, Redwood said that many of the batteries it gathered had plenty of energy left in them, creating an opportunity to turn them into cheap power for energy-hungry data centers. It created a new subsidiary, Redwood Energy, <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/ai-data-center-powered-used-ev-batteries-launches-nevada?rc=fd9gxc\">as we reported</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/munster_gene/status/1981419310242230403\">In a tweet Thursday</a>, Gene Munster, co-founder of Deepwater Asset Management, said he expects stationary batteries eventually to be Redwood’s biggest business.</p>",
