Annualized revenue, or the last month’s revenue multiplied by 12, by last month topped $19 billion, more than triple the pace in January.</p>\n\n<p>The growth comes as company begins early discussions to raise as much as $100 billion at a valuation of around $750 billion before the investment, 50% higher than its valuation two months ago during the share sale. The discussions suggest that private investors still have appetite for fast-growing AI startups even while worries about an AI bubble derail some public tech stocks.</p>",

Udemy’s growth flatlined in the third quarter and its revenue is up just 1.5% in the first nine months of the year. Coursera has done a bit better and reported 10% higher revenues in the third quarter.</p>\n\n<p>Both companies went public in 2021 and their shares are well below their&nbsp; IPO prices. Udemy has lately traded between $5 and $6, compared with its IPO price of $29, while Coursera has been trading around $8 compared with its IPO price of $33. Coursera is offering 0.8 of one of its shares for each Udemy share, valuing it around $6.40 a share. Udemy stock jumped 24% on the news while Coursera was trading up 5%.
