            "body": "<p>Everett Randle, a former partner at Kleiner Perkins investing out of its growth-stage funds, has joined Benchmark as the firm’s newest general partner, the early-stage firm announced Monday. At Kleiner, Randle worked on investments including enterprise search startup Glean and&nbsp;legal AI startup Harvey, earning him a top spot on <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/projects/general-partners-venture-firms-2024?rc=zjctrx\">The Information’s Next General Partners</a> list in 2024.</p>\n\n<p>The hiring follows a slew of personnel departures at Benchmark, the blue-chip firm behind companies like Uber. This year, consumer-focused general partner Sarah Tavel stepped back into a venture partner role, and Victor Lazarte, who led investments for the firm in AI startups Mercor and HeyGen, left the firm to raise his own fund, <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/benchmark-general-partner-victor-lazarte-start-fund?rc=zjctrx\">The Information previously reported</a>. Last year, general partner Miles Grimshaw left to rejoin his prior firm, Thrive Capital. With the addition of Randle, the general partners at the firm—which usually total five—number four, including Peter Fenton, Eric Vishria and Chetan Puttagunta.</p>\n\n<p>Benchmark declined to comment beyond its announcement. Kleiner Perkins spokesperson said in a statement to The Information that “we’re grateful for Ev’s contributions and wish him the very best.”</p>",

            "body": "<p>The court overseeing Elon Musk’s breach of charitable trust lawsuit against OpenAI on Friday ordered OpenAI co-founder and former chief scientist Ilya Sutskever to provide information about his financial stake in OpenAI and a document called the “Brockman Memo,” an apparent reference to OpenAI’s president and co-founder Greg Brockman.</p>\n\n<p>The court <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/murati-deposed-musk-seeks-brockman-memo-sutskever\">initially declined to intervene</a> on the matter because Musk’s lawyers filed their request eight minutes after the deadline. But those lawyers argued that the delay was due to technical difficulties, and the court allowed their request to proceed.</p>\n\n<p>Sutskever’s lawyers opposed Musk’s request for further information, arguing that Sutskever’s financial interests are protected by a Constitutional right to privacy, and the Brockman memo did not fall into the categories of evidence the lawyers had agreed to produce.</p>\n\n<p>The court wrote that “the value of Sutskever’s interest in OpenAI is relevant to his interest in the outcome of the case because if Plaintiffs win, he stands to lose a substantial amount of money.” (Musk is seeking to block OpenAI’s corporate restructuring, which could interfere with OpenAI’s plans to eventually go public, allowing Sutskever and others to sell their financial stakes.) Sutskever could still appeal the ruling.</p>\n\n<p>The court also said that Musk’s lawyers could not have known that the Brockman Memo was available, since it was previously thought that it was “self-deleting,” and the court agreed with Musk’s lawyers that it is relevant to the lawsuit.</p>\n\n<p>Separately, OpenAI’s lawyers asked the court to reject Musk’s claims of breach of charitable trust, fraud and unjust enrichment before they go to trial. They argued that Musk lacks the legal right to bring the charitable trust claim because he made his early donations to OpenAI through donor-advised funds, which “severed Musk’s legal interest in the funds.”</p>\n\n<p><em>This story has been updated to reflect the latest filings from OpenAI and Sutskever’s option to appeal.</em></p>",

In a blog post, Google said it would retire a suite of technologies called the Privacy Sandbox that were originally designed to replace cookies. Advertisers use cookies to help track people’s Web surfing and figure out who is seeing their ads.</p>\n\n<p>Google first announced launche suite of private adveritising solutions known as the privacy sandbox in 2019, and then said it was killing cookies a few months later in January 2020.&nbsp;At that point, Apple was already eliminating trackers on its Safari browser, and the following year would make it much harder for advertisers to track iPhone users. But Google’s efforts struggled to gain momentum. The advertising community was skeptical Google could eliminate cookies without disproportionately benefiting its own ad business, and British regulators started supervising the effort to make sure Google did not behave anti-competitively.</p>\n\n<p>Last year, Google reversed its position and said it would keep third-party cookies but give Chrome users an Apple-style prompt asking them not to be tracked. Then in April, Google said it would offer no prompt at all and <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/meta-renews-work-facial-recognition-tech-privacy-worries-fade\">laid off</a> 10% of Privacy Sandbox staff.</p>",
