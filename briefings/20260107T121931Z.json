Huang added that he doesn’t anticipate problems from the Chinese side once U.S. officials complete licensing reviews.</p>\n\n<p>“We learn about everything through purchase orders. We’re not expecting any press releases or any large declarations,” Huang said, “It’s just going to be purchase orders. If the purchase orders come, it’s because they’re able to place purchase orders.”</p>\n\n<p>President Donald Trump said last month he planned to approve export licenses for the H200, the predecessor to Nvidia’s flagship Blackwell chips, in a deal that includes giving the federal government a 25% cut of sales. H200 was never allowed to sell to China under U.S. chip export controls that took effect in 2022.</p>",

            "body": "<p>OpenAI co-founder and former chief scientist Ilya Sutskever had $4 billion worth of vested equity in OpenAI in November 2023, according to text messages from chief operating officer Brad Lightcap that were made public Tuesday as part of Elon Musk’s lawsuit against OpenAI.</p>\n\n<p>Lightcap disclosed Sutskever’s financial stake after the OpenAI board fired CEO Sam Altman and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella prepared to hire Altman and OpenAI colleagues. Lightcap wrote to Altman and Nadella that paying OpenAI employees for their equity would require $25 billion excluding Sutskever’s equity, or $29 billion including Sutskever’s vested units. (It’s not clear how much Sutskever had in unvested equity.)</p>\n\n<p>The day following the exchange, Microsoft chief technology officer Kevin Scott said publicly that Microsoft would hire and match the compensation of every OpenAI employee who chose to resign from the startup, in the event that Altman was not reinstated at OpenAI. Those hires never happened because the OpenAI board rehired Altman later that night.</p>\n\n<p>Sutskever’s $4 billion stock compensation shows that AI labs have been willing to provide lavish pay for top AI researchers even before last year’s intense war for talent. In 2023, OpenAI was valued at $29 billion and in the process of a tender offer that would value it at $86 billion. Altman has said he does not own equity in OpenAI.</p>\n\n<p>The value of Sutskever’s financial stake in OpenAI has been a matter of contention in the lawsuit. Sutskever refused to reveal the details during a deposition in October, but the court ordered him to sit for a second deposition because the judge found that “Sutskever’s financial interest in OpenAI is directly relevant” to whether his testimony is biased in favor of OpenAI, among other reasons.</p>",

And their offering wasn’t that good technically anyway.”</p>\n\n<p>Microsoft three years later invested $1 billion in the startup, which it later increased to $13 billion, forging a landmark partnership in which Microsoft gets a share of OpenAI’s revenue until 2030 or until the startup develops human-level AI. Amazon made an early bet on Anthropic, though it’s been in talks <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-talks-raise-least-10-billion-amazon-use-ai-chips\">to invest $10 billion in OpenAI</a>, which would use Amazon’s AI chips.</p>\n\n<p>Nadella recounted in his own deposition how rivals quickly moved to recruit OpenAI’s leaders after the board fired Altman in late 2023. Google co-founder Sergey Brin “reached out to” OpenAI president Greg Brockman, Nadella said, according to the transcript of the September deposition, which was also made public Tuesday.</p>\n\n<p>One of Nadella’s goals at the time was “to make sure that Sam and Greg were not just standing up an alternative lab,” he said. But “some of them were getting calls from everybody else, from Sundar [Pichai] and Mark [Zuckerberg] and even Elon [Musk] in some cases.”</p>\n\n<p>In a text message that a lawyer read aloud at the meeting, former OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati wrote following Altman’s termination that “Satya said he’s helping with calming down Sam so he doesn’t do anything hypercompetitive,” such as starting a new AI company. Nadella, two days after Altman’s termination, <a href=\"https://x.com/satyanadella/status/1726509045803336122?s=20\">said</a> he had offered jobs to Altman and Brockman.</p>",

Key AI hires also hail from Meta, including Mingbo Ma, Xubo Liu, Xianfeng Rui, Kainan Peng, Zhihong Lei and Pengwei Li.</p>\n\n<p>Hark has also hired engineers from Google and Amazon, according to the memo, and the startup could grow to 100 engineers during the first half of the year.</p>\n\n<p>Adcock is <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/exclusive-figure-ceo-brett-adcock-launches-new-ai-lab-100-million-funding\">funding Hark with $100 million</a> of his personal capital.

When shoppers search for branded items on Amazon’s site, Amazon will show shoppers items sold on its own site, as well as products only available on outside sites. Some of the product listings include a “Buy For Me” button shoppers can use to buy from other sites without leaving Amazon. In recent days, in viral videos and social media posts, some retailers objected to their products being sold on Amazon through the feature, saying it was confusing for shoppers and sometimes resulted in erroneous orders.</p>\n\n<p>An Amazon spokesperson said that businesses can opt out of the feature at any time and that items will be removed promptly. “Shop Direct and Buy for Me are programs we’re testing that help customers discover brands and products not currently sold in Amazon’s store, while helping businesses reach new customers and drive incremental sales,” the spokesperson said.</p>",

The family of chips are designed to reduce the cost of generating AI tokens by as much as tenfold, when compared with its previous generation chips, the company said.</p>\n\n<p>They also aim to cut the number of GPUs needed to train mixture-of-experts models by a factor of four. Those models use far less computing power by sending each query only to the most relevant parts of the model, rather than activating the entire model at once.</p>\n\n<p>Speaking in a keynote presentation at the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Huang said Nvidia’s new family of self-driving models called Alpamayo are the world’s first that can think and reason. “We imagine that someday a billion cars on a road will all be autonomous,” he said.</p>\n\n<p>Nvidia is making its Alpamayo models open source, which allows outside developers to build their own self-driving cars based on its tech. That could ultimately drive sales of more Nvidia chips.</p>\n\n<p>Huang said the first cars based on Nvidia’s self-driving tech would be made by Mercedes-Benz and be on the road by the first quarter of this year in the U.S. Those cars, however, will only offer Level 2 autonomous driving, which requires drivers to still supervise the vehicle.</p>",

As President Donald Trump confirmed the U.S. had captured Maduro early Saturday morning, the account made profits of $404,222, or a 1,242% return. It’s unclear who’s behind the account, or if the person has other accounts or positions. The account is also currently betting that the U.S. will invade Venezuela and Trump will invoke War Powers against Venezuela by the end of this month.</p>\n\n<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which regulates prediction markets in the U.S., generally forbids contracts related to events such as war, terrorism and assassination, which are contrary to the public interest. Polymarket’s global platform, where the account made its bets, is not open to U.S. users and therefore not subject to U.S. regulations. Polymarket has launched a separate platform for U.S. users.</p>\n\n<p>Kalshi also offers bets on when Maduro would be leaving office, though there’s currently no bet on potential U.S. invasion of Venezuela.</p>",

That was even lower than the analyst consensus estimate of about 423,000 that Tesla had flagged earlier this week, an apparent effort to lower expectations. The quarter was expected to show a drop, thanks to the September 30 expiration of a U.S. federal tax credit for electric vehicles.</p>\n\n<p>But Tesla’s full year sales were down significantly, reflecting both the maturing of the electric vehicle market and the impact of Elon Musk’s political activities on Tesla’s sales. Tesla delivered a total of 1.64 million vehicles in 2025, down 9% from 1.79 million in 2024. The company’s best-ever year for sales was 2023, when it delivered 1.81 million vehicles. Tesla shares closed down&nbsp;nearly 3% on Friday.</p>\n\n<p>Notably, the sales decline has been worse for Tesla’s newer and pricier models like the Cybertruck and Model S. Deliveries of “other models,” a category that excludes the popular Model 3 and Model Y vehicles, were down 51% year-over-year for the fourth quarter and 40% for the entire year.</p>",
