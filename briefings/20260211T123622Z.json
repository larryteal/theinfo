Gao worked on image and video models, while Lee was part of the firm’s AI software team known as Macrohard.</p>\n\n<p>The departures come at a time when xAI is going through major changes. Earlier this month, Musk’s aerospace company SpaceX announced a merger with xAI. The deal valued SpaceX at $1 trillion and xAI at $250 billion.</p>",

ASML is the world’s largest supplier of extreme ultraviolet lithography tools, which are critical to making advanced chips.</p>\n\n<p>Some of the current U.S. restrictions target specified entities in China&nbsp;rather than impose&nbsp;a blanket countrywide ban on equipment entering China, they said. The lawmakers urged the Trump administration to press U.S. allies to implement “countrywise controls” for China on all the key chip-making equipment and subcomponents that China can’t produce.</p>\n\n<p>They added they wanted the Trump administration to brief them by next month&nbsp;on its strategy for strengthening these export controls, along with a timeline for the goal.</p>",

Earlier this month, SpaceX announced a merger with xAI and Musk pitched the idea of operating data centers in space as part of the logic behind the merger.</p>",

Early users of the model are praising its ability to produce sophisticated multi-shot scenes with synchronized sound effects, music and dialogue in multiple languages. So far, Seedance 2.0 is available only to a limited number of users of Jimeng, ByteDance’s AI image and video app in China, and Jianying, the company’s Chinese video editing app.</p>\n\n<p>On X and other social media platforms, users have shared many videos that they say were created by Seedance 2.0, including a <a href=\"https://x.com/EHuanglu/status/2020547445869117882?s=20\">Star Wars-like sci-fi clip</a> packed with action and sound effects and many anime and <a href=\"https://x.com/NACHOS2D_/status/2020295747741057507?s=20\">videogame-like</a> footages, as well as what resembles a <a href=\"https://x.com/tuolaji2024/status/2020083327907373103?s=20\">scene</a> from a 1970s-style Hong Kong kung fu movie.</p>\n\n<p>Competition in the AI video market is intensifying as more Chinese companies roll out new models. ByteDance’s Seedance 2.0 comes just days after its Chinese rival Kuaishou launched its new AI video generation model called Kling 3.0, which also received positive reviews on social media.</p>",

Microsoft sells competing products including its Agent 365, which aims to help companies keep track of different AI agents—including those offered by OpenAI—and connect those agents to other applications so they can reorganize files or create forecasts based on data stored in those applications.</p>\n\n<p>Althoff provided talking points salespeople could use in selling Microsoft’s tools, including that Microsoft has years of experience providing large enterprises with security and compliance guarantees.
