The announcement is part of xAI’s effort to build an enterprise business to compete with the likes of Anthropic and OpenAI.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://x.ai/news/grok-business#real-business-outcomes-built-together\">new offerings</a> include Grok for Business, which is aimed at small-to-medium-sized businesses and costs $30 per user per month, and Grok Enterprise, which does not have publicly posted pricing and is aimed at larger companies. Both versions of Grok work with tools like Google Drive and have secure logins and billing designed for companies, xAI said. The enterprise version has extra features such as additional audit and security tools.</p>\n\n<p>xAI faces an uphill battle winning over enterprise customers because it doesn’t have a large sales team and has a limited record selling to companies, though it has some small deals with companies such as Morgan Stanley and Palantir, <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/xai-uphill-battle-selling-grok-businesses\">The Information has reported</a>. Musk’s own companies have also become enterprise customers for Grok, including by adding the chatbot to Tesla vehicles and using it for Starlink customer service at SpaceX.</p>",

That was even lower than the analyst consensus estimate of about 423,000 that Tesla had flagged earlier this week, an apparent effort to lower expectations. The quarter was expected to show a drop, thanks to the September 30 expiration of a U.S. federal tax credit for electric vehicles.</p>\n\n<p>But Tesla’s full year sales were down significantly, reflecting both the maturing of the electric vehicle market and the impact of Elon Musk’s political activities on Tesla’s sales. Tesla delivered a total of 1.64 million vehicles in 2025, down 9% from 1.79 million in 2024. The company’s best-ever year for sales was 2023, when it delivered 1.81 million vehicles. Tesla shares closed down&nbsp;nearly 3% on Friday.</p>\n\n<p>Notably, the sales decline has been worse for Tesla’s newer and pricier models like the Cybertruck and Model S. Deliveries of “other models,” a category that excludes the popular Model 3 and Model Y vehicles, were down 51% year-over-year for the fourth quarter and 40% for the entire year.</p>",

Fourth quarter 2025 sales have long been expected to shrink because a U.S. tax credit for electric vehicles expired on Sept. 30, causing some consumers to buy vehicles earlier in the year. But sales were depressed earlier in the year as well, with some attributing the decline to consumer dissatisfaction with Elon Musk’s political activities.</p>\n\n<p>Tesla usually posts delivery figures for each quarter on the first trading day of the following quarter, which would be this coming Friday for the fourth quarter of 2025. But it is unusual for Tesla to share compilations of analyst predictions before it releases delivery figures.

This gives the startup’s venture capital backers an exit with handsome returns less than a year after the product was launched.</p>\n\n<p>For example, Benchmark, which led the startup’s April funding round at a valuation of $500 million, gets to sell its stake just eight months later at more than four times the valuation. The Meta deal offers a big return for the startup’s earliest backer, Chinese venture capital firm ZhenFund. ZhenFund made a seed investment in the startup, Butterfly Effect, in February 2023, at a valuation of just $14 million, when Manus as a product didn’t exist yet and the team was working on an earlier project. ZhenFund, well-known in China for its focus on early-stage startups, participated in all the subsequent funding rounds for Butterfly Effect including this year’s Benchmark-led round.</p>\n\n<p>At the time of Meta’s deal, ZhenFund was the startup’s largest outside shareholder with a stake of more than 10%, according to the person. Other significant shareholders—Benchmark, Chinese VC firm HongShan (also known as HSG) and tech giant Tencent—each held a single-digit percentage stake.</p>\n\n<p>The acquisition came at an opportune time for the Manus team and its backers. Google’s recent launch of its highly capable Gemini 3 models and other AI products highlighted the tech giant’s strength in agentic AI, raising more questions about the long-term sustainability of independent AI agent startups.</p>",

            "body": "<p>A crypto company that struck a partnership with the Trump family’s World Liberty Financial has fired an audit firm it hired weeks earlier whose license was reported to have expired in August.</p>\n\n<p>Crypto processor <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/trump-family-crypto-deal-runs-aground\">Alt5 Sigma</a> was a largely-unknown Nasdaq-listed company until August. Then&nbsp; it struck a $1.5 billion deal with World Liberty, a crypto company co-founded by the President’s two eldest sons, to use Alt5 as a vehicle to buy and store World Liberty’s crypto token, $WLFI.</p>\n\n<p>Shares in Alt5 have tumbled more than 80% since the deal. Two CEOs have departed Alt5 amid legal and regulatory problems, including the disclosure of a conviction for alleged money laundering in Rwanda, The Information <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/trump-family-crypto-deal-runs-aground\">previously reported</a>. Several other senior executives have quit or have been fired.</p>\n\n<p>Alt5 in early December appointed Victor Mokuolo CPA PLLC as the company’s new independent auditor, following the resignation of the company’s previous auditor. Texas state filings show the license of the new audit firm expired in August, meaning the firm is currently barred from doing audit work, the Financial Times <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/342d01b2-bf0f-47d7-bb61-0f1aa0997ffd\">reported</a> on Monday.</p>\n\n<p>In a securities filing on Monday, Alt5 Sigma said it had “dismissed” the auditor on Christmas Day. Alt5 Sigma said it appointed L J Soldinger Associates, LLC its new auditor.</p>\n\n<p>Alt5 Sigma earlier told the Financial Times that Victor Mokuolo CPA PLLC was undergoing a peer review under the Texas State Board of Accountancy regulations, which was due to be completed in January 2026. The audit firm received a failing grade under the peer review process in 2023, and has received fines from the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board for reporting failures in 2023 and 2024.</p>",
