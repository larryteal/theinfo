            "body": "<p>Blue Origin, the space company founded and owned by Jeff Bezos, took a major step forward by successfully launching its giant New Glenn rocket and landing its booster stage on a barge off the coast of Florida.</p>\n\n<p>It was a landmark achievement for Blue Origin in its ambitions of creating reusable rockets capable of delivering satellites into orbit and eventually astronauts and cargo to the moon. As part of Thursday’s launch, Blue Origin also successfully deployed its payloads in space, including two NASA spacecraft headed to Mars as part of the agency’s Escapade mission.</p>\n\n<p>Blue Origin is mostly known for sending tourists to the edge of space on its reusable 63-foot tall New Shepard rocket. New Glenn, in contrast, is 321-feet tall and will allow Blue Origin to compete for commercial and government launch contracts against Elon Musk’s SpaceX. New Glenn is in a similar class to Starship, SpaceX’s new 400-plus foot tall rocket.</p>\n\n<p>While SpaceX has successfully launched hundreds of rockets and dominates the commercial space business, it has also struggled with technical mishaps that have caused multiple explosions of its Starship rockets. Blue Origin landed New Glenn on its second launch attempt.</p>",

Amazon’s initial constellation for the system is expected to consist of more than 3,000 satellites, which will deliver wireless internet to areas on Earth that are underserved by conventional forms of internet service.</p>\n\n<p>So far, Amazon has launched only the first 150 or so of those satellites, which the company began launching in April. The company expects that it will require more than 80 rocket launches to deploy all of the satellites for its initial constellation. The service will compete with Starlink, the dominant satellite internet service, which is operated by Elon Musk’s SpaceX and <a href=\"https://satellitemap.space/constellation/starlink\">has more than 8,000</a> active satellites orbiting Earth.</p>",

For example, Tencent a few months ago hired <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/u-s-loses-appeal-chinese-ai-researchers?rc=jnr9wn\">Yao Shunyu</a>, a researcher who was working for OpenAI. Yao is known for his research on agentic AI.</p>\n\n<p>Tencent’s AI model team has struggled to compete against domestic rivals such as Alibaba Group and ByteDance. But Lau said there is no clear winner in the market yet. “At this point in time, we actually do not believe that there is a decisively better model in China, as everybody is locked in a pretty close race…..We don’t believe we are behind,” he said.</p>\n\n<p>Despite Tencent’s focus on AI model development, its capital expenditure in the quarter decreased 24% from a year earlier. That’s in part because Tencent has enough chips stockpiled from previous purchases to keep developing its own AI models, according to Lau.</p>\n\n<p>Separately, Bloomberg <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-13/apple-and-tencent-agree-to-15-fee-on-wechat-mini-game-purchases\">reported</a> Thursday that Tencent had reached an agreement to allow Apple to process payments and collect 15% commissions from transactions in mini apps that operate within Tencent’s WeChat messaging app.</p>",

It recently launched a line of athletic clothing through a collaboration with Nike that could expand to footwear and accessories in the future.
