Terms of the deal were not disclosed.</p>\n\n<p>The Clearing Company, founded in March and based in San Francisco, was created to take on Polymarket and Kalshi, the two dominant platforms. Its founder Toni Gemayel worked as head of growth at both Polymarket and Kalshi. It <a href=\"https://www.clearing.co/blog/announcing-our-seed-round\">raised</a> $15 million in August from investors including Union Square Ventures, Haun Ventures and Coinbase Ventures.</p>\n\n<p>The race to launch prediction markets is heating up, with DraftKings and FanDuel entering the market this month. The industry could face more consolidation. The Clearing Co. has applied for a clearinghouse license with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. If approved, the acquisition will bring a valuable license to Coinbase, which is currently using Kalshi as a vendor.</p>",

The suit, filed in federal court in California, accused SerpApi, which scrapes Google’s search results and sells those results to other companies, of bypassing technology restricting access to Google’s search access results pages. Because those pages contain copyrighted material such as the Knowledge Panels that Google licenses from partners, Google argued in the complaint that SerpApi’s actions violate the Copyright Act.</p>\n\n<p>In a statement, SerpApi said that its actions were protected by the First Amendment. “SerpApi has not been served with Google’s complaint, and prior to filing, Google did not contact us to raise any concerns or explore a constructive resolution,” SerpApi’s general counsel Chad Anson wrote.</p>\n\n<p>Earlier this month, a federal judge issued a final remedies judgment on how to address Google’s illegal search monopoly, including a requirement that Google must syndicate its search results to qualified competitors, which will likely include OpenAI. Google’s suit against SerpApi may signal that Google is willing to be more aggressive now that its search monopoly case has been resolved in court.

The grant will increase his percentage stake to 19.8%.</p>\n\n<p>“We reverse the Court of Chancery’s rescission remedy and award $1 in nominal damages,” Delaware Supreme Court judges wrote in an <a href=\"https://courts.delaware.gov/Opinions/Download.aspx?id=389200\">opinion</a> issued Friday. The Chancery court had <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/meet-the-lawyer-who-took-away-elon-musks-56-billion\">overturned</a> the 2018 compensation package in January 2024 in response to a shareholder lawsuit, finding that Musk had too much sway over the company’s board of directors. In Friday’s opinion, the supreme court said that the court’s decision to rescind Musk’s pay package was too extreme.</p>\n\n<p>The ruling further cements Musk’s control over Tesla. In November, he <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/elon-musks-victory\">handily won shareholder approval</a> for a new compensation package worth $1 trillion if Tesla hits a series of ambitious financial and product goals over the next decade.</p>",
