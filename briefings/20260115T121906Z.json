            "body": "<p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company on Thursday announced a record capital expenditure between $52 billion and $56 billion for 2026, as it tries to ease the capacity constraint on its production facilities.</p>\n\n<p>About 70% to 80% of the spending will go to manufacturing equipment for cutting-edge chips, with the remainder split between chips for automotive and industrial uses, and advanced packaging technologies, TSMC CFO Wendell Huang said on an earnings call. By comparison, the company’s capital expenditure was $40.9 billion in 2025 and $29.8 billion in 2024.</p>\n\n<p>TSMC, which manufactures more than 90% of the world’s most advanced semiconductors, projects its revenue will grow nearly 30% this year. The company reported revenue in the December quarter grew 25.5% to $33.7 billion from a year earlier, and full-year 2025 revenue climbed 35.9% to $122 billion. The revenue growth is driven by tech companies racing to build AI infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p>CEO C.C. Wei said on the call that demand for cutting-edge AI chips continues to outstrip what TSMC can produce. Since new factories take two to three years to build, the company plans to squeeze more output from existing plants and upgrade older equipment to help bridge the gap over the next two years.</p>\n\n<p>Wei addressed concerns about whether demand for AI chips can last. “You’re trying to ask us whether AI demand is real or not. I’m also very nervous about it,” he told analysts. “If we don’t do it carefully, that’d be a big disaster for TSMC.”</p>",

Alibaba said the app, powered by the company’s own <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/alibaba-helped-china-take-lead-u-s-open-source-ai?rc=jnr9wn\">AI foundation models</a>, now has 100 million monthly active users.</p>\n\n<p>Alibaba said the latest upgrade is part of its strategy to bring advanced AI capabilities into “practical, everyday use.” For example, the integration with Taobao’s instant commerce service—which offers a one-hour delivery of groceries and other everyday items—allows the Qwen app to order food and beverages online and complete the purchases for users.</p>\n\n<p>The latest upgrade comes after the Qwen app last month integrated Alibaba’s popular mapping app, Amap. The access to Amap enabled Qwen to offer more accurate and relevant travel planning as well as restaurant and hotel recommendations.</p>",

The move is the latest example of how China is ramping up its effort to reduce its dependence on American AI chips and become more self-sufficient in critical areas of technology.</p>\n\n<p>Beijing-based Zhipu described the new model, GLM-Image, as China’s first state-of-the-art AI model that completed the entire process of training on domestic chips. The company said it hopes that the new model will serve as “valuable references” for the industry to tap into the potential of China’s domestic chips.</p>\n\n<p>The company’s Hong Kong-listed shares soared 19% on Wednesday following the announcement. Zhipu, founded by a group of researchers at Tsinghua University, went public on Friday under its corporate name, Knowledge Atlas Technology. The stock has increased more than 36% since the debut.</p>\n\n<p>Zhipu’s launch of the Huawei-trained model aligns with the Chinese government’s policy of promoting domestic alternatives to Nvidia. The Information <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/china-restricts-nvidia-chip-purchases-special-circumstances?rc=jnr9wn\">reported</a> on Tuesday that the Chinese government told some tech companies it would only approve their H200 purchases under special circumstances, such as for university research and development labs.</p>",

But the impact of the tariffs have not been as intense as originally feared, prompting Amazon’s change of heart, the Financial Times report said.</p>\n\n<p>Amazon’s change of mind comes as the Supreme Court is expected to rule on the legality of Trump’s tariffs as soon as this week. An Amazon spokesperson told The Information that their annual vendor negotiation cycles have not changed and that prices of products in their store have not increased outside normal fluctuations. Amazon says the company talked to suppliers about cost reductions based on the reduction of tariff rates to China in November.</p>",

In a statement, a Google spokesperson called Penske’s allegations “meritless.” “Advertisers and publishers have many choices and when they choose Google’s ad tech tools it’s because they are effective, affordable and easy to use,” the spokesperson said.</p>\n\n<p>In the past two years, Google lost a pair of monopoly suits brought by the Justice Department, with federal judges ruling that Google had used exclusive distribution deals to illegally maintain its search monopoly, and that Google had a monopoly in the part of its ad tech business that helps independent websites sell ad space. Companies have started to sue Google based on the monopoly findings. Yelp sued Google in 2024, alleging that Google used its monopoly in search to gain an advantage over competitors like Yelp in the local search business.</p>\n\n<p>Penske’s lawsuit follows a suit it filed against Google last September over traffic drops it blamed on AI Overviews, arguing that Google was illegally tying inclusion in its AI Overviews product, which some publishers have complained about, to being indexed in search, a lifeblood for most website publishers. Google on Monday filed to dismiss the September suit, arguing that Penske’s claims weren’t supported by the law.</p>",

It is aimed at regulating Chinese companies that use cloud computing services to rent servers equipped with Nvidia’s AI chips at data centers located in Southeast Asia or other regions outside China.</p>\n\n<p>Such offshore arrangements have become common among Chinese companies as a way to get around U.S. export controls that ban the sale of advanced U.S. chips to China, <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/google-microsoft-help-chinese-firms-skirt-ban-on-nvidia-chips?rc=jnr9wn\">The Information reported</a> previously.
