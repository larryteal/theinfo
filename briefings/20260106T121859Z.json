            "body": "<p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang on Monday announced a new autonomous driving model that aims to help cars reach Level 4 autonomous driving, in which a driver isn’t required to supervise the vehicle.</p>\n\n<p>Separately, Huang also announced more detailed specifications for the company’s upcoming next-generation flagship AI chips, known as Rubin. The family of chips are designed to reduce the cost of generating AI tokens by as much as tenfold, when compared with its previous generation chips, the company said.</p>\n\n<p>They also aim to cut the number of GPUs needed to train mixture-of-experts models by a factor of four. Those models use far less computing power by sending each query only to the most relevant parts of the model, rather than activating the entire model at once.</p>\n\n<p>Speaking in a keynote presentation at the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Huang said Nvidia’s new family of self-driving models called Alpamayo are the world’s first that can think and reason. “We imagine that someday a billion cars on a road will all be autonomous,” he said.</p>\n\n<p>Nvidia is making its Alpamayo models open source, which allows outside developers to build their own self-driving cars based on its tech. That could ultimately drive sales of more Nvidia chips.</p>\n\n<p>Huang said the first cars based on Nvidia’s self-driving tech would be made by Mercedes-Benz and be on the road by the first quarter of this year in the U.S. Those cars, however, will only offer Level 2 autonomous driving, which requires drivers to still supervise the vehicle.</p>",

He most recently led its software practice and advised on deals including Zendesk’s $10 billion sale to Permira and Hellman &amp; Friedman, Mailchimp’s $12 billion sale to Intuit and CA Technologies’s $18 billion sale to Broadcom.</p>\n\n<p>Cayne, who took a break after 2023, said in an interview that he’s excited to return to investment banking at Goldman at a time where artificial intelligence is reshaping global industries. He’ll be based in San Francisco and work alongside existing co-heads Joe Porter in London and Jason Rowe in New York.</p>\n\n<p>The bank is gearing up for what it anticipates to be an “extremely active” period that could top 2021, a year where tech M&amp;A and IPO volume both hit record-highs, according to Porter.</p>\n\n<p>The three Goldman bankers believe traditional software firms and private equity investors are grappling with AI, presenting opportunities for advisory work. There’s also a new crop of highly-valued AI startups that could step up as buyers of software companies.</p>\n\n<p>“Suddenly you’ve got some new players on the field, which have massive capital availability and are all looking to figure out what part of the value chain they can play in,” said Rowe.</p>\n\n<p>Goldman Sachs has led rivals in global software dealmaking and advised more than $990 billion worth of deals since 2022, more than half of total software mergers by volume, according to Dealogic. In 2025, the bank advised on Chronosphere’s $3.35 billion sale to Palo Alto Networks, Electronic Art’s $55 billion take-private by an investor consortium and cybersecurity startup Wiz’s $32 billion sale to Google.</p>",

            "body": "<p>Tesla delivered 16% fewer vehicles in the fourth quarter of 2025 than it did during the same period during the previous year, a worse-than-expected finish to the company’s second full year of falling sales.</p>\n\n<p>The Elon Musk-led automaker delivered 418,000 vehicles in the October-to-December quarter compared to 472,000 one year earlier. That was even lower than the analyst consensus estimate of about 423,000 that Tesla had flagged earlier this week, an apparent effort to lower expectations. The quarter was expected to show a drop, thanks to the September 30 expiration of a U.S. federal tax credit for electric vehicles.</p>\n\n<p>But Tesla’s full year sales were down significantly, reflecting both the maturing of the electric vehicle market and the impact of Elon Musk’s political activities on Tesla’s sales. Tesla delivered a total of 1.64 million vehicles in 2025, down 9% from 1.79 million in 2024. The company’s best-ever year for sales was 2023, when it delivered 1.81 million vehicles. Tesla shares closed down&nbsp;nearly 3% on Friday.</p>\n\n<p>Notably, the sales decline has been worse for Tesla’s newer and pricier models like the Cybertruck and Model S. Deliveries of “other models,” a category that excludes the popular Model 3 and Model Y vehicles, were down 51% year-over-year for the fourth quarter and 40% for the entire year.</p>",

Notably,&nbsp;the <a href=\"https://ir.tesla.com/press-release/delivery-consensus-fourth-quarter-2025\">consensus</a> implies analysts expect a 15% year over year drop in the number of vehicles Tesla will deliver in the fourth quarter of 2025.</p>\n\n<p>That would mean the year would end with deliveries down 8% from last year. Fourth quarter 2025 sales have long been expected to shrink because a U.S. tax credit for electric vehicles expired on Sept. 30, causing some consumers to buy vehicles earlier in the year. But sales were depressed earlier in the year as well, with some attributing the decline to consumer dissatisfaction with Elon Musk’s political activities.</p>\n\n<p>Tesla usually posts delivery figures for each quarter on the first trading day of the following quarter, which would be this coming Friday for the fourth quarter of 2025. But it is unusual for Tesla to share compilations of analyst predictions before it releases delivery figures. The consensus posted by Tesla also showed sales recovering in 2026 and continuing to climb for the next few years.</p>",

This gives the startup’s venture capital backers an exit with handsome returns less than a year after the product was launched.</p>\n\n<p>For example, Benchmark, which led the startup’s April funding round at a valuation of $500 million, gets to sell its stake just eight months later at more than four times the valuation. The Meta deal offers a big return for the startup’s earliest backer, Chinese venture capital firm ZhenFund. ZhenFund made a seed investment in the startup, Butterfly Effect, in February 2023, at a valuation of just $14 million, when Manus as a product didn’t exist yet and the team was working on an earlier project. ZhenFund, well-known in China for its focus on early-stage startups, participated in all the subsequent funding rounds for Butterfly Effect including this year’s Benchmark-led round.</p>\n\n<p>At the time of Meta’s deal, ZhenFund was the startup’s largest outside shareholder with a stake of more than 10%, according to the person. Other significant shareholders—Benchmark, Chinese VC firm HongShan (also known as HSG) and tech giant Tencent—each held a single-digit percentage stake.</p>\n\n<p>The acquisition came at an opportune time for the Manus team and its backers. Google’s recent launch of its highly capable Gemini 3 models and other AI products highlighted the tech giant’s strength in agentic AI, raising more questions about the long-term sustainability of independent AI agent startups.</p>",
