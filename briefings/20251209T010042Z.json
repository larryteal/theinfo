The payment feature is powered by Stripe, the companies said, although consumers will be able to pay for purchases with their digital wallets like Apple Pay and Google Pay soon.</p>\n\n<p>The launch is the latest tie-up between OpenAI and a retailer as the ChatGPT maker aims to push deeper into e-commerce. Walmart, Etsy and Shopify have all said they will make their products available through ChatGPT’s Instant Checkout feature, which allows shoppers to make purchases without leaving their chat window. Target announced plans to make its app available via ChatGPT’s new app feature last month, though it didn’t specify whether it would use Instant Checkout to facilitate purchases.</p>\n\n<p>Instacart has long had close ties with OpenAI—Instacart was an early partner for features like the company’s Operator agent, and OpenAI executives Fidji Simo joined after a stint as Instacart’s CEO. ChatGPT product head Nick Turley, who also previously worked at Instacart, <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/chatgpt-product-chief-responding-code-red?rc=d8mrkd\">has said</a> one of his biggest priorities is enabling more personalization of ChatGPT through app integrations and helping users use ChatGPT to complete more tasks.</p>",

The data excludes users from China.</p>\n\n<p>Gemini’s share of weekly downloads on mobile apps rose to 33% for the week of Nov. 24, up from 29% during the prior two weeks. ChatGPT’s weekly share fell to 42% for the week of Nov. 24 from 46% and 45% during the prior two weeks. Gemini 3 launched November 18.</p>\n\n<p>Still, more people are using ChatGPT. Over that period, just under 90% of mobile app user sessions among chatbots involved ChatGPT. Gemini had about 4% share of those sessions, while Perplexity and DeepSeek had fewer. The data did not include visits to the chatbots’ web sites.</p>\n\n<p>ChatGPT users were also using the app more than 8 times a day vs. 2.5 for Gemini in late November.&nbsp; The information speaks to how much further Google has to go to make use of its flagship AI products a habit after the initial surge of interest in its latest model.</p>\n\n<p>Google’s resurgence has rattled OpenAI. The company’s chief financial officer, Sarah Friar, last month addressed some investors’ concerns that time spent on ChatGPT has declined, in part due to content restrictions introduced to prevent its chatbot from chatting with teens about adult topics, such as suicide. The company is currently rolling out age-vertification features, which would allow verified adults to discuss topics such as erotica.</p>",

Many of today’s best-known AI models, such as GPT-5, were trained using Hopper 100 or 200-series&nbsp;chips. Nvidia previously sold a much less powerful version of its Hopper chips, the H20, to China.</p>\n\n<p>One question is how the Chinese government will react to the availability of H200. China has instructed many of the company’s biggest AI developers to limit their use of Nvidia chips so that China’s homegrown AI server chips, including Huawei’s can flourish. Nvidia sales to China have petered out this year.</p>\n\n<p>But given that chips from Huawei are better suited to running existing AI models, known as inference, as opposed to developing new models, China may be more open to local companies using the Nvidia H200 chips for model-training purposes.</p>\n\n<p>Shares of Nvidia rose around 2% in after-hours trading on Monday. Spokespeople for Nvidia and Commerce didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Semafor earlier reported on the White House decision, which temporarily boosted Nvidia shares during normal trading hours. Nvidia <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/nvidia-projects-strong-revenue-growth-54-october-quarter?rc=c48ukx\">previously said</a> the Trump administration wanted the U.S. government to keep 15% of Nvidia’s sales to China.</p>\n\n<p>The White House decision is a win for Trump advisers such as David Sacks, a venture capitalist who has argued that restricting sales to China would help local Chinese chipmakers and that those firms would then make gains in selling chips to other nations that would otherwise buy American technology.</p>",

In the Netflix deal, WBD shareholders will also get shares in a new company holding the cable channels, closing the gap between the two offers.</p>\n\n<p>WBD stock quickly jumped 4.4% to $27.23, just below the Netflix price. Paramount said it had lined up $54 billion in debt financing and $41 billion in equity financing from Larry Ellison and&nbsp;a fund affiliated with RedBird Capital Management,&nbsp;several Middle Eastern funds and an investment fund controlled by Jared Kushner. Ellison,&nbsp;the Oracle co-founder whose son David runs Paramount, is worth at least $255 billion based on the value of his Oracle stake alone.&nbsp;But the Paramount offer’s big advantage is that the Ellisons are close to the Trump administration and will likely have an easier time getting approval for the purchase.</p>\n\n<p>Warner said in a statement its board would review the Paramount offer and respond within 10 days.</p>",

In recent years, Confluent has touted its software’s ability to give AI models access to fresh data, and OpenAI has used Confluent’s software to analyze how customers are using ChatGPT and other products.</p>\n\n<p>But Confluent’s sales growth has been slowing due to increasing competition and customers getting better at controlling their cloud spending, and the company had reportedly been exploring a sale after receiving takeover interest two months ago.</p>\n\n<p>Confluent, which manages the open source Apache Kafka software, would be a logical fit for IBM, which has made several big bets on open source companies. These include its acquisition of Red Hat in 2019 for $34.5 billion—the largest software deal in history—and last year’s purchase of cloud management tool provider&nbsp;HashiCorp for $6.4 billion. If the Confluent deal happens, it would mark one of IBM’s biggest acquisitions in recent years as it pivots further into software, cloud and AI under CEO Arvind Krishna.</p>",

In September, Mehta released his preliminary judgment on remedies, which required that Google stop exclusive search distribution contracts and mandated some data sharing with search engine rivals but avoided the most extreme remedies such as forcing a sale of Chrome that plaintiffs led by the Department of Justice had requested.</p>\n\n<p>After the September judgment, <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/antitrust-judge-bars-google-exclusive-deals-require-chrome-sale?rc=n9lbpq\">viewed</a> by antitrust experts as a positive outcome for the search company, Google and the Department of Justice filed separate <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/google-justice-department-file-dueling-remedies-proposals-antitrust-search-case?rc=n9lbpq\">proposals</a> dueling over how to interpret the judge’s ruling. Friday’s final judgment hewed more closely to the government’s proposal, including Mehta’s decision on generative AI products. The judge also ruled that Google must renegotiate any contracts for search or generative AI defaults every year, and that agreements with Apple have to be device-by-device and access point by access point.</p>\n\n<p>Google and the Department of Justice did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Google previously said that it would appeal Mehta’s initial finding of the illegal monopoly, and the Department of Justice said after Mehta’s remedies ruling earlier this month that it was considering its options.</p>",

The EU <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_2934\">cited</a> several issues with X’s practices, including the “deceptive design” of X’s blue checkmark system, which the bloc said makes it “difficult for users to judge the authenticity of accounts” and makes it more likely they will fall for scams and manipulation. X has also failed to adequately maintain a database of ads or share information with researchers, which are requirements under the DSA, the EU said.</p>\n\n<p>For Musk, maintaining the X site has been less of a priority this year than growing xAI, his artificial intelligence company, which acquired X in March.
