            "body": "<p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company on Thursday announced a record capital expenditure between $52 billion and $56 billion for 2026, as it tries to ease the capacity constraint on its production facilities.</p>\n\n<p>About 70% to 80% of the spending will go to manufacturing equipment for cutting-edge chips, with the remainder split between chips for automotive and industrial uses, and advanced packaging technologies, TSMC CFO Wendell Huang said on an earnings call. By comparison, the company’s capital expenditure was $40.9 billion in 2025 and $29.8 billion in 2024.</p>\n\n<p>TSMC, which manufactures more than 90% of the world’s most advanced semiconductors, projects its revenue will grow nearly 30% this year. The company reported revenue in the December quarter grew 25.5% to $33.7 billion from a year earlier, and full-year 2025 revenue climbed 35.9% to $122 billion. The revenue growth is driven by tech companies racing to build AI infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p>CEO C.C. Wei said on the call that demand for cutting-edge AI chips continues to outstrip what TSMC can produce. Since new factories take two to three years to build, the company plans to squeeze more output from existing plants and upgrade older equipment to help bridge the gap over the next two years.</p>\n\n<p>Wei addressed concerns about whether demand for AI chips can last. “You’re trying to ask us whether AI demand is real or not. I’m also very nervous about it,” he told analysts. “If we don’t do it carefully, that’d be a big disaster for TSMC.”</p>",

By doing so, the technique can free up computing resources to be used for more complex reasoning tasks.</p>\n\n<p>DeepSeek is close to launching its next-generation flagship AI model, V4, which features strong coding capabilities, The Information <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/deepseek-release-next-flagship-ai-model-strong-coding-ability?rc=jnr9wn\">reported</a> last week. V4, a successor to the V3 model the firm released in December 2024, is expected to be released around the Lunar New Year in mid-February.</p>\n\n<p>The research paper, entitled “Conditional Memory via Scalable Lookup,” was co-authored by DeepSeek founder Liang Wenfeng and several DeepSeek researchers, as well as a few researchers from Peking University.&nbsp; DeepSeek also released the code for Engam on Github.</p>",

In a statement, a Google spokesperson called Penske’s allegations “meritless.” “Advertisers and publishers have many choices and when they choose Google’s ad tech tools it’s because they are effective, affordable and easy to use,” the spokesperson said.</p>\n\n<p>In the past two years, Google lost a pair of monopoly suits brought by the Justice Department, with federal judges ruling that Google had used exclusive distribution deals to illegally maintain its search monopoly, and that Google had a monopoly in the part of its ad tech business that helps independent websites sell ad space. Companies have started to sue Google based on the monopoly findings. Yelp sued Google in 2024, alleging that Google used its monopoly in search to gain an advantage over competitors like Yelp in the local search business.</p>\n\n<p>Penske’s lawsuit follows a suit it filed against Google last September over traffic drops it blamed on AI Overviews, arguing that Google was illegally tying inclusion in its AI Overviews product, which some publishers have complained about, to being indexed in search, a lifeblood for most website publishers.
