With the stablecoin, Klarna can enter new markets, broaden offerings and lower operating costs, Zach Abrams, co-founder and CEO of Bridge, said in a tweet.</p>\n\n<p>The race for fintech and crypto firms to launch stablecoins intensified after the U.S.’s passage of stablecoin law in July. Most of the new stablecoins are <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/new-stablecoin-law-spurring-competition-threatening-profits\">launched</a> through partnerships with white-label issuers such as Bridge and Anchorage Digital, which share revenue generated from the stablecoins with their partners.</p>\n\n<p>Klarna’s partnership is another win for Bridge, which is already issuing stablecoins for crypto exchange Hyperliquid and crypto wallets Phantom and MetaMask. Klarna, Bridge and Stripe all counted Sequoia as their venture backer. Anchorage, a crypto custodian and another popular issuer, won deals to issue Western Union’s stablecoin and Tether’s new U.S.-focused stablecoin.</p>",

NVIDIA is a generation ahead of the industry — it’s the only platform that runs every AI model and does it everywhere computing is done.”</p>\n\n<p>In addition to the Meta deal, The Information reported that Google is pitching large financial institutions on the idea of using TPUs in their own data centers as part of a program called “TPU@Premises,” as Google tries to compete with Nvidia for the vast market of putting chips in companies’ own on-premise data centers. The share price of Alphabet, Google’s parent company, rose about 1% on Tuesday.</p>\n\n<p>Analysts on Tuesday attributed the stock moves to The Information’s reporting, noting that companies are looking for an alternative to reduce reliance on Nvidia. Brad Erickson at RBC Capital Markets wrote that Google’s share increase was “warranted where the market is better appreciating GOOGL’s fully flanked AI strategy,” including Search and Cloud.</p>",

As Shopping Research is browsing for potential recommendations, it collects user feedback on its preliminary recommendations and asks for more specific details about what shoppers are looking for along the way to help steer the model’s answers. OpenAI says that for simpler shopping questions like checking price or confirming details, a regular ChatGPT response is quicker and most useful. But more in-depth comparisons or tradeoffs between different products are better suited for Shopping Research, which spends a few minutes browsing before presenting users with a “buyer’s guide” listing pros and cons of top recommendations.</p>\n\n<p>The feature isn’t yet connected to ChatGPT’s other e-commerce features like in-chat checkout, and OpenAI isn’t collecting any revenue from the feature. Shopping Research draws recommendations from product reviews and other sites it thinks are trustworthy, and cites its sources in responses to help explain why it made a particular choice, though executives cautioned the feature can still make mistakes.</p>",

Existing investors Lux Capital, Thrive Capital and Jeff Bezos participated, along with new investors Index Ventures and T. Rowe Price, according to the report.</p>\n\n<p>Pi develops AI models intended to power a wide variety of robots to perform a wide variety of tasks. On Monday, Pi announced its latest model, π*0.6, which learned in part from its own experiences operating a robot in the real world. That training made the model faster at tasks such as assembling boxes and folding laundry than previous models.</p>\n\n<p>The one-year-old startup was founded by former Google employees and professors from Stanford University and the University of California, Berkeley, as well as early Stripe employee and venture capitalist Lachy Groom. Pi previously raised about $470 million from investors, most recently at a valuation of $2.4 billion including the money, from investors including Thrive Capital, Lux Capital, Khosla Ventures, Redpoint Ventures and Bond Capital.</p>",

On Nov. 4, 2024, Lets Deel transferred $6,000 to a Revolut account owned by Alba Basha, the wife of Deel chief operating officer Dan Westgath, the documents show. Basha’s account sent $6,000 in another transaction moments later to Keith O’Brien, the alleged spy, the documents show.</p>\n\n<p>Basha, a former compliance officer at Revolut, has not responded to requests from The Information. She is now employed as a compliance specialist at Dubai-based fintech Ziina, according to her Linkedin profile. Ziina co-founder Faisal Toukan did not respond to earlier requests for comment.</p>\n\n<p>Rippling accused Deel and its top brass earlier this year of recruiting and paying its now-former Irish employee O’Brien to pass internal information to Deel. O’Brien later confessed to the alleged scheme in an affidavit filed in the High Court of Ireland. Deel has countersued Rippling for defamation and is defending the lawsuit. Deel has pointed to an agreement in which Rippling promised to cover O’Brien’s legal, travel and associated costs as validation of O’Brien’s “conflict as a trustworthy source.”</p>\n\n<p>“We believe that information will show he has even more financial incentive to align himself with Rippling,” a Deel spokesperson said.</p>\n\n<p>In a court filing, Rippling alleged: “The records involve only two transactions: Deel corporate funds entering Basha’s account and immediately exiting to pay a corporate spy. Her account balance before and after: $8.16. This is not personal financial activity. It is money laundering.”</p>",
